    <p>The SADL documentation, both for users of SADL and developers of SADL, is
      being migrated to GitHub Pages (see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages">
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages</a>).
      This replaces documentation previously hosted at <a href="http://sadl.sourceforge.net">http://sadl.sourceforge.net</a>.
      When the migration is complete, nothing of other than historical
      significance will be hosted on SourceForge. One clear advantage of using
      GitHub Pages is that, unlike the github Wiki, one can construct any valid
      Web content in whatever form one desires including HTML and PDF and have
      complete control of the location and hyperlinks.</p>
    <p>The SADL documentation in GitHub Pages is sadl repo-specific. It is kept
      in a branch, "gh-pages" intended only to contain documentation. In fact,
      this branch has all other content deleted and so should never be merged
      with other branches. The documentation root is the "docs" folder at the
      repo root level. This is configured in the repo's Settings.</p>
    <p>The documentation intended for SADL users is in the root "docs" folder.
      Most images used in the user documentation are in the "images" subfolder.
    </p>
    <p>The documentation intended for SADL developers is in the "developers"
      folder under "docs". This folder also has an "images" subfolder where most
      images used in developer documentation can be found. The "developer"
      folder also has a "SupportingMaterial" subfolder. This contains, for
      example, the MS PowerPoint file containing the source for many of the
      images that are not screen shots.</p>
    <p>The "javadoc" folder under the "developer" folder contains JavaDocs
      generated from source code. The JavaDocs content is divided into folders.
      For example, the top-level JavaDoc documentation of SadlServer is in
      "developer/javadoc/sadlserver" folder. To regenerate this content, do the
      following in a command window.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Change directory to
        ".../sadl/sadl3/com.ge.research.sadl.parent/com.ge.research.sadl.server"</li>
      <li>Run the Maven command "mvn package javadoc:javadoc javadoc:aggregate"</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The JavaDocs will be generated in the following directories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> com.ge.research.sadl.server/target/site/apidocs (aggregating both
        below) </li>
      <li>com.ge.research.sadl.server/com.ge.research.sadl.server.server-api/target/site/apidocs
        </li>
      <li>com.ge.research.sadl.server/com.ge.research.sadl.server.server-impl/target/site/apidocs
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Since the first location is the aggregation of the second two, it is
      probably sufficient to copy the content of this folder to the GitHub Pages
      content location "developer/javadoc/sadlserver". See GitHub issue <a href="https://github.com/SemanticApplicationDesignLanguage/sadl/issues/574">https://github.com/SemanticApplicationDesignLanguage/sadl/issues/574</a>
      and GitHub pull request <a href="https://github.com/SemanticApplicationDesignLanguage/sadl/pull/575">https://github.com/SemanticApplicationDesignLanguage/sadl/pull/575</a>
