<p>The SADL documentation, both for users of SADL and developers of SADL, is 
being migrated to GitHub Pages (see
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages">
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages</a>). 
This replaces documentation previously hosted at
<a href="http://sadl.sourceforge.net">http://sadl.sourceforge.net</a>. When the 
migration is complete, nothing of other than historical significance will be 
hosted on SourceForge. One clear advantage of use GitHub Pages is that, unlike 
the github Wiki, one can construct any valid Web content in whatever form one 
desires.</p>
<p>The SADL documentation in GitHub Pages is sadl repo-specific. It is kept in a 
branch, &quot;gh-pages&quot; intended only to contain documentation. In fact, this branch 
has all other content deleted and so should never be merged with other branches. 
The documentation root is the &quot;docs&quot; folder at the repo root level. This is 
configured in the repo's Settings.</p>
<p>The documentation intended for SADL users is in the root &quot;docs&quot; folder. Most 
images used in the user documentation are in the &quot;images&quot; subfolder. </p>
<p>The documentation intended for SADL developers is in the &quot;developers&quot; folder 
under &quot;docs&quot;. This folder also has an &quot;images&quot; subfolder where most images used 
in developer documentation can be found. The &quot;developer&quot; folder also has a &quot;SupportingMaterial&quot; 
subfolder. This contains, for example, the MS PowerPoint file containing the 
source for many of the images that are not screen shots.</p>
