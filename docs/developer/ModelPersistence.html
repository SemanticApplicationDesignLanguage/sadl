    <p>The SADL IDE uses Apache Jena as the interface to in-memory OWL models
      created when a SADL model is processed by the Xtext model processor and as
      the interface to OWL model persistence. The in-memory OWL model, which
      exists as an instance of the Jena <em>org.apache.jena.ontology.OntModel</em>
      class, is persisted when the SADL model from which it was created is
      saved. There are multiple options for how this persistence is
      accomplished. The purpose of this document is to explain the mechanism for
      both persisting OWL models and for retrieving OWL models from the
      persistence repository. OWL models must be retrieved whenever a SADL model
      imports another model and when inference is run, queries are performed,
      models are graphed, etc.</p>
    <p>Apache Jena includes the Java interface class <em>org.apache.jena.rdf.model.ModelGetter
        </em>to retrieve models from the persistence repository. The class
      documentation states, "A ModelGetter object can retrieve a Model given a
      URL for it. If it doesn't have such a Model, it returns null." The SADL
      class <em>com.ge.research.sadl.jena.inference.SadlJenaModelGetter</em>
      implements the <em>ModelGetter</em> interface class as well as the <em>com.ge.research.sadl.jena.inference.ISadlJenaModelGetter</em>
      interface class. Jena's default persistence mechanism is as an OWL file in
      any one of several serialization formats, as specified in the SADL
      preferences. The <em>ISadlJenaModelGetter</em> interface adds methods to
      support getting models from triple stores, e.g., Jena TDB. The class <em>com.ge.research.sadl.jena.inference.SadlJenaModelGetterPutter
        </em>extends <em>SadlJenaModelGetter </em>by adding methods to support
      saving a model to the target persistence repository.</p>
    <p>Jena also uses the class <em>org.apache.jena.ontology.OntModelSpec</em>,
      which "Encapsulates a description of the components of an ontology model,
      including the storage scheme, reasoner and language profile." This class
      encapsulates a field of type <em>OntDocumentManager</em>, in the same
      package, which "Provides services for managing ontology documents,
      including loading imported documents, and locally caching documents from
      resolvable URL's to improve load performance." The <em>OntModelSpec</em>
      class also includes the methods <em>getBaseModelMaker</em>, <em>getImportModelMaker,
        </em>and<em> setImportModelGetter</em>. </p>
    <p>SADL uses an implementation of the class <em>com.ge.research.sadl.reasoner.IConfigurationManager</em>
      or one of its extensions, <em>com.ge.research.sadl.reasoner.IConfigurationManagerForEditing</em>
      or <em>com.ge.research.sadl.builder.IConfigurationManagerForIDE</em>, to
      manage the SADL configuration, including the relevant <em>OntModelSpec</em>
      and <em>OntDocumentManager</em> instances. </p>
    <p>When the SADL IDE processes a SADL model in the <em>com.ge.research.sadl.jena.JenaBasedSadlModelProcesso</em>r
      <em>onValidate</em> method, it retrieves the instance of <em>IConfigurationManagerForIDE</em>
      for the Xtext resource (the current SADL file), from which it retrieves an
      instance of <em>OntModelSpec</em> and <em>OntDocumentManager</em>. It
      then calls the <em>OntModelSpec</em>'s method <em>setImportModelGetter</em>
      with an instance of the class <em>SadlJenaModelGetterPutter</em>. Then,
      before starting to process the SADL file parse tree to construct the
      corresponding OWL <em>OntModel</em>, it calls <em>org.apache.jena.rdf.modelModelFactory's
        createOntologyModel</em> method, passing in the <em>OntModelSpec</em>
      instance, to create an empty <em>OntModel</em>. Import statements
      encountered in the parse tree will result in import statements in the <em>OntModel</em>'s
      triples. On save, this <em>OntModel</em>'s triples are persisted to the
      persistence repository using the instance of <em>SadlJenaModelGetterPutter</em>
      stored in the <em>OntModelSpec</em>. Furthermore, whenever Jena loads an
      OWL model from the persistence repository, again using the instance of <em>SadlJenaModelGetterPutter</em>
      in the <em>OntModelSpec</em>, Jena will also load all of the model's
      imports in the same way.</p>
    <p>Because of the central role played by the <em>SadlJenaModelGetterPutter</em>,
      support for additional triple store persistence repositories can be added
      by extending the <em>SadlJenaModelGetterPutter</em>'s <em>saveModel</em>
      method and the <em>SadlJenaModelGetter</em>'s <em>getModel</em> method.</p>
