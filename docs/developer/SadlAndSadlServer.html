<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>SADL is both a controlled-English language and an integrated development 
environment (IDE). The IDE provides an editing environment in which to create, 
test, and maintain OWL-based knowledge bases. However, it is often the case that 
the actual application of the knowledge base--its achievement of its 
purpose--requires access to the knowledge in a very different environment from 
the one in which it was developed. For this reason SadlServer exists--to provide 
access to knowledge bases as a service. Figure 1 illustrates these two ways of 
accessing knowledge.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure 1: Knowledge Base Development and Delivery</b></p>

<p>Figure 1 shows a third role besides expert developers and end users--the IT 
folks who standup the server environments that provide the knowledge as a 
service (KaaS).</p>

<p>The knowledge base created and maintained in the SADL IDE consists of OWL 
models and rule files in some target representation. These are not SADL-dependent 
and can be used by any compatible software. The unique aspect of SadlServer is 
that it takes the knowledge base exactly as created in the SADL IDE (the 
OwlModels folder in specific) and delivers it to the server environment with all 
of the configuration information necessary to identify what reasoner to use and 
how to configure it. This is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Figure 2: A Knowledge Base's OWL and Rules Content and 
the Configuration Information Passes from the IDE to the Server (on the Right).</b></p>

<p>SADL is architected to support any reasoner that is wrapped in a Java API 
conforming to the IReasoner Interface. To persist knowledge (OWL models and 
rules) in a format that can be consumed by that reasoner, a corresponding 
translator conforming to the ITranslator Interface class must also be provided. 
The translator takes input in the SADL in-memory Intermediate Form and outputs 
the knowledge in the format required by the reasoner. A reasoner and a 
compatible translator are referred to as a reasoner/translator pair. Because 
both the reasoner and the translator are invoked through the Java ServiceLoader, 
additional reasoner/translator pairs can be added to the SADL IDE by adding them 
to the Java classpath. The configuration file contains the information necessary 
for the server environment to load the reasoner and translator. More detail on 
this plug-in architecture is shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Figure 3: The Reasoner/Translator Plug-in Architecture.</b></p>

<p>It is highly desirable to maintain the knowledge base in some kind of source 
code or version control system and Figure 3 shows such a system system between 
the development and server environments. Of course this is not required but no 
serious knowledge development effort should ever proceed without this safeguard 
on loss of artifacts.</p>
