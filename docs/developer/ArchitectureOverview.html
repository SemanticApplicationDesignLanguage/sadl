<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The SADL IDE consists of a number of interdependent Eclipse plug-ins that may 
be installed in an instance of Eclipse to provide a rich knowledge base editing 
environment. The plug-ins are installed together as the SADL feature. The same 
code base also generates the servers for WebSADL. This document gives an 
overview of the SADL Version 3 codebase. This document provides an overview of 
the plug-ins, their functions, and their major components.</p>
<h2>SADL Plug-ins</h2>
<p>The screenshot below shows the Eclipse plug-in development Package Explorer 
view of the SADL codebase. All of the projects are Maven projects. The 
com.ge.research.sadl.parent project is the Maven parent of all of the projects 
below it. The top-level com.ge.research.sadl3.documentation project contains the 
Github Pages documentation.</p>
