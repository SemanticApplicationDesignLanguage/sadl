    <p>The SADL IDE is architected to allow a variety of reasoners to be used.
      Each reasoner must be wrapped in Java code implementing the IReasoner Java
      Interface class so that it can be invoked from the IDE or from SadlServer.
      In the SADL IDE, each reasoner must also have an associated translator
      capable of translating rules and queries from the SADL Intermediate Form,
      generated from the SADL grammar, to a form compatible with the reasoner.
      The translator must be wrapped in Java code implementing the ITranslator
      Java Interface class. This plug-in architecture is illustrated in the
      diagram below.</p>

    <p>The presence of multiple reasoner/translator pairs implies that a
      selection is possible.&nbsp; In the Eclipse-based IDE, this selection
      process is accessed through the project properties.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Right-click on the desired project in the Project Explorer and select
        "Properties" or select the project and then click on Project, then
        Properties on the menu bar. In either case, the result will be the
        project properties dialog window.</li>
      <li>Expand the SADL item by clicking on the arrow in front of it.</li>
      <li>Click on Reasoner Preferences.</li>
      <li>Check the box in front of the desired reasoner in the upper portion of
        the dialog. The default translator for the selected reasoner will be
        automatically selected in the lower portion of the dialog.</li>
      <li>Change the translator selection if desired.</li>
      <li>Edit the reasoner configuration options, if any are available.</li>
    </ol>
