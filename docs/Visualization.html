    <h2>Visualization in SADL Version 3</h2>
    <p>In SADL Version 3, the graphing package is a plug-in accessed as a
      service implementing the Java Interface class<i>
        com.ge.research.sadl.model.visualizer.IGraphVisualizer. </i>The
      SADL-IDE's SADL preference "Graph renderer package and class" setting is,
      by default, the GraphViz implementation in <i>
        com.ge.research.sadl.model.visualizer.GraphVizVisualizer</i>. Any
      visualizer implementing the <i>IGraphVisualizer</i> Interface class can
      be placed on the Java classpath and specified in this preference.</p>
    <h3>Generating Graphs with GraphViz</h3>
    <p>GraphViz can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">
        http://www.graphviz.org/</a> and should be placed on a path without
      spaces or other "difficult" path characters. Once installed, there should
      be a "bin" folder under the installation directory with "dot" and "dotty"
      executables.</p>
    <p>GraphViz creates graphs as SVG files in the Graphs project subfolder.
      Generating a graph also results in an attempt to open the graph file using
      the application associated with the SVG file type in Eclipse. With an
      appropriate file association, graphs will automatically be opened in an
      appropriate viewer, e.g., a Web browser such as Chrome or the internal Web
      browser.</p>
    <p>When the GraphVizVisualizer is used, the location of the GraphViz bin
      folder must be specified in the OS environment variable GraphVizPath, e.g,
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GraphVizPath<i>=C:\Apps\graphviz-2.36\release\bin</i></p>
    <p>Also, when the GraphVizVisualizer is used, the dot file can be retained
      (not automatically deleted after the SVG file is created) by setting the
      OS environment variable GraphVizKeepDot to true: </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GraphVizKeepDot =true.</p>
    <p>Note that Eclipse must be restarted after setting environment variables
      for them to become visible to Eclipse. (For some reason, a reboot has
      sometimes been found to be necessary to make the environment variable
      visible in Eclipse.)</p>
    <h4>Adding GraphViz Attributes</h4>
    <p>GraphViz has many node and edge attributes that can be used to give
      shape, color, tooltips, and more to graphs. For detailed information see <a
        href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html">
        https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html</a>. </p>
    <p>SPARQL queries can be constructed that will generate ResultSets that
      provide attribute values to nodes and edges in the resulting graph. This
      is accomplished as follows. The names of the first three columns of the
      ResultSet are the names of the variables for the directed graph's
      head-node, edge label, and tail-node, respectively. More columns can be
      included in the result set to provide additional attribute information by
      giving a column a name composed of one of the name of one of the first
      three columns concatenated with an underscore and the name of an attribute
      that is meaningful for the column with the prefixed name. For example,
      consider a query with this beginning:</p>
    <font color="#2a00ff" size="2">
      <blockquote>
        <p>"select distinct ?N1 ?link ?N2 ?N1_style ?N1_fillcolor ?N2_style
          ?N2_fillcolor (?cplist as ?N1_tooltip) where </p>
      </blockquote>
    </font>
    <p>The first column, the head-node, is named "N1". The edge label is named
      "link". The tail-node is named "N2". The 4th column sets the style of the
      head-node, the 5th column sets the fill color of the head-node. The 6th
      column sets the style of the tail-node. The 7th column sets the fill color
      of the tail-node. The 8th column, which is called "cplist" in the query
      but renamed to "N1_tooltip", sets a tooltip for the head-node. The header
      and first row of this ResultSet might look like this:</p>
    <font size="2">
      <p align="LEFT">
"N1","link","N2","N1_style","N1_fillcolor","N2_style","N2_fillcolor","N1_tooltip"<br>
        "HeadNode","link-label","TailNode","filled",:yellow","filled","red","I'm
        a tooltip; I show up when you mouse over my node"</p>
    </font>
    <h3>On-Demand Graph Generation Options</h3>
    <p>There are two basic graphing commands available on the SADL dropdown
      menu: "Show Graph" and "Graph Ontology". (In the SADL perspective, "SADL"
      appears in the top menu bar; the SADL (gear) icon on the tool bar also has
      this dropdown menu.) </p>
    <h4>Show Graph</h4>
    <p>The result of "Show Graph" depends upon what is selected before invoking
      the command. The answer to the "How many edges from anchor?" question will
      determine the size of the graph generated around the "anchor" concept or
      model.</p>

    <h3>Graphing by SADL Statement</h3>
    <p>Graphs can also be generated from SADL statements within a .sadl file.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ask: "construct ....".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // will generate a graph for
        a valid SPARQL construct statement (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct">
          http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct</a> )</li>
      <li>Graph: "select ?s ?p ?v where {....}".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // will
        construct a graph; requires a result with 3 columns (3 variables in the
        select)</li>
    </ol>
