    <p>An ontology, also known as a semantic model, is a conceptualization of a
      domain; a definition of the concepts that are relevant to that domain. It
      is like a dictionary except that it is a formalization which allows the
      concepts defined in the ontology to have meaning for computers as well as
      for people. The concepts defined in the ontology become the
      domain-specific elements that can be used in other models, e.g., to write
      if/then rules, to write queries, to capture system requirements, etc.</p>
