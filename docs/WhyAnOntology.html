<p>An ontology, also known as a semantic model, is a conceptualization of a 
domain; a definition of the concepts that are relevant to that domain. It is 
like a dictionary except that it is a formalization which allows the concepts 
defined in the ontology to have meaning for computers as well as for people. The 
concepts defined in the ontology become the domain-specific elements that can be 
used in other models, e.g., to write if/then rules, to write queries, to capture 
system requirements, etc.</p>
