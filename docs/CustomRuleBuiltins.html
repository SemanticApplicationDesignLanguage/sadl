    <p>Functions are a foundational concept in predicate logic.(See <a
        href="Tutorial/FCSM_Outline.html">Foundational Concepts in Semantic
        Modeling</a>, Part 2: Logic.) In OWL plus rules, functions appear as built-ins in
      rules. What built-in functions are available for use in a rule depends
      upon what reasoner has been selected. Likewise, the way in which custom
      built-in functions can be added to those already available depends upon
      the reasoner/translator pair which are selected.</p>
