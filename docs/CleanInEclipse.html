    <p>The Eclipse <em>Clean</em> command, <em>Project -&gt; Clean...</em> on
      the menu bar, removes all OWL files from the <em>OwlModels</em> folder.
      Other cleaning effects include removing obsolete mappings from the mapping
      file (ont-policy.rdf) in the <em>OwlModels</em> folder, regenerating
      metrics files in the <em>OwlModels</em> folder, removing Prolog files
      from the <em>OwlModels</em> folder, recreating the reasoner-specific <em>SadlBuiltinFunctions.sadl</em>
      file in the <em>ImplicitModel</em> folder, and cleaning the <em>Temp</em>
      folder.</p>

    <p>It is essential that the menu bar's <em>Project</em> dropdown menu has <em>Build
        Automatically</em> checked. If it is not checked no new OWL files and
      rule files will be created in the <em>OwlModels</em> folder in the course
      of doing a project clean. Of course <em>Build Project</em> can be
      initiated manually from the <em>Project</em> dropdown menu as an
      alternative.</p>
    <p>Occasionally the state of the SADL IDE will become corrupted and behave
      in unexpected ways, including not running inference as expected. Doing a
      Clean/Build on the project will often resolve such problems.</p>
