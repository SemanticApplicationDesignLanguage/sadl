        SADL Projects</a>.</p>
    <p>The Eclipse-based SADL IDE supports importing two types of files: OWL
      model files and CSV tabular data files.</p>
    <h2>Importing OWL Model Files</h2>
    <p>The Eclipse-based SADL IDE includes an exploratory capability to import
      OWL models into a SADL project as SADL files. Note that this is NOT the
      same as <a href="ExternalModels.html">using external OWL models</a>
      within a project. Adding an external OWL model to a project makes that OWL
      model available to be imported (as is, as an OWL model) into a SADL
      model.&nbsp; By contract, importing an OWL model attempts to translate the
      OWL model into a SADL representation. Since SADL only supports OWL 1 plus
      qualified cardinality (see <a href="PropertyRestrictions.html">Property
        Restrictions</a>), OWL 2 models may have content which is not translated
      or is not translated correctly into the SADL grammar.</p>
    <p>To import an OWL model into a SADL project, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The OWL model to be translated should be available as an OWL file in a
        supported format on the file system but NOT in the project to which it
        is to be imported. </li>
      <li>Select <em>File -&gt; Import</em> on the top menu bar <br>
        <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="images/Import2.png" alt="" style="width: 372px; height: 474px;"><br>
          <br>
        </div>
        or right-click on the project and select <em>Import</em> on the
        resulting context menu.<br>
        <br>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="images/Import1.png" alt="" style="width: 399px; height: 639px;"></div>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Select <em>SADL -&gt; Owl Files</em> in the resulting modal dialog
        window.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/Import3.png" alt="" style="width: 434px; height: 453px;"></li>
      <br>
      <li>Click <em>Next</em>.</li>
      <li>In the resulting modal dialog, browse to the <u>folder</u> containing
        the OWL file, then select the file to be imported. Make sure to set
        "Into folder" to the project and possibly the subfolder into which the
        resulting SADL files is to be created. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/Import4.png" alt="" style="width: 577px; height: 528px;"></li>
      <br>
      <li>Click on <em>Finish</em> to complete the import. If there are no
        errors, a SADL file translation of the OWL file will be placed in the
        target folder.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Importing CSV Tabular Data Files</h2>
    <p>Tabular data in the form of a comma-separated-values (CSV) file can also
      be imported to create either an OWL file or a SADL file. Doing so requires
      a template file to specify the mappings between the values in the CSV file
      and the semantic concepts identified in the resulting semantic model.
      Importing CSV files is covered in detail in <a href="CsvDataImporter.html#ImportCSVWizard">The
        SADL-IDE Import CSV Wizard</a> in the <a href="CsvDataImporter.html">CSV
        Tabular Data Importer</a> document.<br>
