    <h2>Content Assist</h2>
    <p>People are much better at recognizing than recalling. Therefore, when
      composing content in the controlled-English SADL grammar, it can be
      difficult to remember exactly what can be written next but much easier to
      recognize what one wants to write from a list of possibilities. Providing
      this list of possible next words or names in the grammar (after the
      current cursor location) is called content assist.</p>
    <p>The Eclipse-based SADL IDE provides content assist. By default in most
      environments, the key binding for content assist is <em>control-space</em>
      (hold down the Control key and press the Space Bar). The key binding for
      content assist can be viewed/modified by going to the Preferences menu,
      General -&gt; Keys, and scrolling down to "Content Assist".</p>
    <p>Normally a request for content assist will result in the display of a
      list of possibilities. However, if there is only one possibility found it
      will be automatically inserted into the editor after the current cursor
      location. </p>
    <p><strong>Note</strong> that if the cursor is at the end of a word it may
      be necessary to add a space before the expected content assist for next
      words will be computed. Otherwise content assist will look for matches
      that extend the characters before the cursor to create a valid option.</p>
    <h2>Templates</h2>
    <p>Eclipse provides a means of extending content assist through <a href="https://help.eclipse.org/2021-03/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fconcept-editor-templates.htm&amp;resultof%3D%2522%2574%2565%256d%2570%256c%2561%2574%2565%2522%2520%2522%2574%2565%256d%2570%256c%2561%2574%2522%2520"
        title="Templates in Eclipse">templates</a>. Templates are
      fill-in-the-blank snippets of the language that are accessible through
      content assist. Templates appear at the bottom of the list of content
      assist possibilities. </p>
    <p>For example, selecting the template for "Create Class" from the content
      assist menu at the beginning of a new statement results in the insertion
      of a class declaration into the editor with the new class name selected,
      ready to be replaced with whatever is typed. </p>
    <img src="images/CAT1.png" alt="">
    <p>After typing the new name, pressing the Tab key will move the cursor to
      the next entry, in this case the end of the declaration where the
      statement can be continued by user input or through additional content
      assist.</p>
    <p>The SADL distribution includes some template options including "Create
      Class", Create Subclass", and "Create Property". Users can add their own
      templates for the grammar constructs that they use often by going to
      Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; SADL -&gt; Templates and clicking on "New".
      Templates can be enabled by checking or disabled by unchecking.</p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>Disregarding comments, a SADL model must begin with the keyword <em>uri</em>.
      If a new .sadl files is created and content assist is then requested, the
      result will be the insertion of this keyword:</p>
    <p><img src="images/CA1.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>The keyword <em>uri</em> must be followed by a valid URI string. If
      content assist is requested again, the default URI for the model will be
      inserted, since it is the only item in the list. Note that the first part
      of the default URI can be controlled by setting the Base URI in <a href="PreferenceAndProjectProperties.html">SADL
        Preferences</a>. The last part of the default URI is derived from the
      SADL file name. </p>
    <p><img src="images/CA2.png" alt=""></p>
    <p>After the required uri statement has been completed, a request for
      content assist will give a list of all of the keywords that can begin a
      new statement. </p>
