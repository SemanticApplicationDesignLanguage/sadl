    <p class="MsoNormal">The Semantic &nbsp;Application Design Language (SADL)
      began at the end of 2007 at GE Research (GR). Andy Crapo had been working
      on a project with Mike Graham to capture knowledge for equipment overhaul.
      He had suggested the use of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to capture a
      model of the domain, but Mike felt that engineers would never be
      comfortable using Protégé, which was the free editor of choice for OWL at
      that time. Andy attended the Automated Software Engineering Conference in
      Atlanta, GA in November and sat behind Stanley Sutton of the IBM Research
      Center. During a break Stan showed Andy Eclipse IMP, a set of Eclipse
      plug-ins generalizing the Eclipse Java Development Tool Kit (JDK) in order
      to support defining the grammar of a domain-specific language (DSL) and
      providing an integrated development environment (IDE) for the language
      with content assist, outlining, hyperlinking, error checking, quick fix,
      etc. (see : <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/imp/IMP_Creation-Review.pdf"
        style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
        http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/imp/IMP_Creation-Review.pdf</a> ). A
      light bulb came on and Andy envisioned a DSL that allowed subject matter
      experts to write controlled-English statements that mapped directly to
      OWL. Upon returning to GR, he proposed capturing knowledge in OWL by
      providing such a DSL and Mike was supportive. Significant work went into
      defining a grammar that, when a model snippet expressed in the language
      was shown to a domain engineer, would be immediately understandable. Amy
      Aragones provided consulting on font and coloring for the semantic
      highlighting. Thus was born SADL Version 1 in early 2008.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">SADL Version 1 was built on top of Jena from HP Labs in
      Bristol, England. Besides model statements translated to OWL, SADL
      supported rules, which were translated either to Jena Rules for a
      Jena-based reasoner or Semantic Web Rules Language (SWRL) rules for the
      Pellet reasoner. It also supported queries written in the W3C graph query
      language SPARQL. By the end of 2008 Aviation had given approval and SADL
      was released to Open Source on SourceForge (see <a href="http://sadl.sourceforge.net"
        style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">
        http://sadl.sourceforge.net</a>). Concurrent with SADL 1 development was
      the development of a knowledge server which ran independent of Eclipse and
      could be invoked by clients either using a Java API or a Web Service
      implementation using SOAP messaging. This knowledge server came to be
      known as SadlServer because deploying knowledge bases from the SADL IDE to
      the server was accomplished by simply copying the knowledge base folder to
      the server file system. Both the Java API and the Web Service API
      implemented the same Java Interface class, making it easy to move from one
      to the other.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">When John Interrante started working on the project he
      identified Xtext as a more mature DSL development suite than IBM's IMP and
      SADL Version 2 was built on top of Xtext (see <a href="https://eclipse.org/Xtext/">
        https://eclipse.org/Xtext/</a>). In Version 2 the grammar of SADL was
      expanded to provide support for all of OWL 1 and qualified cardinality
      from OWL 2. This scope was primarily defined by what Jena supported as the
      OWL translation still used the Jena API. The architecture of SADL 2 was
      improved to support use of any reasoner provided that a) it was wrapped so
      as to operate in conformance with the IReasoner API and b) it had at least
      one associated translator that operated in conformance with the
      ITranslator API. A user could select and configure the desired reasoner
      and select a supporting translator via the project properties interface,
      with those configuration settings being passed directly to the SadlServer
      kbase folder so that SadlServer would operate as specified in the IDE.
      Supported reasoners for SADL 2 included Jena and two flavors of Prolog.
      SADL 2 had an Open Source release and a GE-Only release with additional
      functionality. </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">SADL 3 was developed to better support the Aviation
      ASSERT™ Verification and Validation tool (see <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0v_HDh9LTAhVCJ5oKHQEsDi0QFggjMAA&amp;url=http://www.mys5.org/Proceedings/2016/Day_2/2016-S5-Day2_0845_Durling.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNEwhOft2yvW1Tx8AtHNbnX1Gojw_Q&amp;s">
        Safety Critical Software and Systems Research @ General Electric</a>).
      The grammar was re-implemented in a much cleaner manner with extensive
      help from Sven Efftinge at <a href="http://sadl.sourceforge.net/sadl3/FoundationalConcepts.htmlhttps:/www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1lsHzh9LTAhWjA5oKHWlNBxEQFggjMAA&amp;url=https://typefox.io/&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZXY6hkmUNNOkCJWzALl6CHt">
        TypeFox</a> and the architecture enhanced to support two important
      functions. a) Model processors are plug-ins, opening the way for a model
      processor that uses the OWL API rather than Jena, which would facilitate
      moving from OWL 1 to OWL 2. b) The SADL grammar is extensible by other
      grammars, e.g., the SADL Requirements Language (SRL) grammar used in
      ASSERT™ and the Dialog grammar used in <a href="https://github.com/GEGlobalResearch/DARPA-ASKE-TA1/wiki">GE's
        ASKE TA1 ANSWER system</a>. This makes extensions possible with very
      little additional grammar. SADL 3 also has extensive graphing capability,
      allowing ontology models and concept neighborhoods to be visualized as
      well as perceived in the controlled-English format.</p>
