    <p><br>
      The Ask Statement is a statement in the <a href="SADLGrammar.html">SADL
        grammar</a> that is used to create a persistent query as part of a SADL
      model. The query can be executed against an inferred model created from
      the model containing the Ask Statement by the menu item <a href="TestModel.html">Test
        Model</a>.</p>
    <p>The Ask Statement begins with the keyword <em>Ask</em> followed by a
      colon. This may be followed by a query in one of two forms.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The query can be a quoted string containing a largely opaque query in
        a format supported natively by the reasoner/translator pair selected.
        For Jena-based reasoner/translator pairs, the supported syntax is
        SPARQL. The SWI-Prolog reasoner/translator pair supports either SPARQL
        or Prolog queries.</li>
      <li>The query can be written as an expression in the SADL grammar. The
        SADL grammar supports a subset of SPARQL and so can only be used for
        relatively simple queries. A query in SADL syntax is translated by the
        selected translator into a query supported by the selected reasoner.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Named Queries</h2>
    <p>A query can be given a name by inserting a non-conflicting name after the
      <em>Ask</em> keyword and before the colon. The query can then be
      referenced elsewhere, and executed when testing the model, by referencing
      the query name after <em>Ask:</em> ("Ask followed by a colon").</p>
