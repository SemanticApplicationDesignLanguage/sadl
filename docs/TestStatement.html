    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <a href="SADLGrammar.html">SADL grammar</a> supports <em>Test</em>
      statements consisting of the <em>Test</em> keyword, followed by a colon,
      followed by the test to be executed. There are two kinds of <em>Test</em>
      statements in SADL. The first kind is a statement in a SADL model (a .sadl
      file) and consists of an expression in the <a href="ExpressionsInSADL.html">SADL
        expression grammar</a> that will evaluate to <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>.
      Upon running inference (executing <em>Test Model</em>), if the statement
      evaluates to <em>true</em>, the test passes. Otherwise the test fails.
      The screen shot below showed a <em>Test</em> statement of this type and
      the results of running T<em>est Model</em> on the SADL model.</p>

    <p>The second kind is a statement in a test suite (a .test file). In this
      case "Test:" is&nbsp; followed by the URI of a SADL model containing <em>Test</em>
      statements of the first kind. This causes all of the <em> Test</em>
      statements in the specified SADL model to be executed as part of the test
      suite. Individual test results as well as summary information is displayed
      in the console window. This is illustrated in the screen shot below
      showing a test suite referencing three SADL models.</p>

    <p>The Eclipse-based SADL IDE includes a Test Suite Editor which can be used
      to open and edit files ending with ".test". This editor has content assist
      and hyperlinking to referenced SADL models. Content assist in shown in the
      screen capture below.</p>

    <h2>Test Statement in the SADL Grammar</h2>
    <p>As noted above, a test statement in the SADL grammar is the <em>Test:</em>
      prefix followed by a SADL expression which can be evaluated to true or
      false. </p>
