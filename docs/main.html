    <p>The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is an important, widely used semantic
      modeling language. Models in OWL provide a robust foundation upon which
      semantic rules can be added to capture additional domain knowledge. </p>
    <p>The Semantic Application Design Language (SADL) provides an English-like
      language for building semantic models and authoring rules. The SADL
      Integrated Development Environment (SADL-IDE) is an Xtext-based set of
      Eclipse plug-ins for editing, maintaining, and managing models, rules,
      tests, and queries expressed in SADL. By default the SADL-IDE uses the
      Apache Jena reasoner/rules engine and a SADL-to-Jena translator to save
      models as OWL files and rules in Jena rule format. However, the SADL-IDE
      is designed to accept any translator/reasoner pair conforming to the SADL
      plug-in architecture so models and rules can be saved to the required
      format for any target reasoner. This permits applications to use whatever
      reasoner provides the best reasoning capability for the domain. Currently
      SWI-Prolog is available as a reasoner. Previous versions of SADL supported
      the Pellet reasoner.</p>
