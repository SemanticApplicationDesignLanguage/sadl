<p>The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is an important, widely used semantic 
modeling language. Models in OWL provide a robust foundation upon which semantic rules can be added to capture 
additional domain knowledge.</p>
<p>The Semantic Application Design Language (SADL) provides an English-like 
language for building 
semantic models and authoring rules. The SADL Integrated 
Development Environment (SADL-IDE) is 
an Eclipse plug-in for editing, maintaining, and managing models, rules, tests, 
and queries expressed in SADL. By default the SADL-IDE uses the Jena 
reasoner/rules engine and a SADL to Jena translator to save models as OWL files 
and rules in Jena rule format. However, the SADL-IDE is designed to accept any 
translator/reasoner pair 
conforming to the SADL  plug-in architecture so models and rules can be saved to 
the required format for any target reasoner. This will permit applications to 
use Jena, Pellet, OntoBroker™, AllegroGraph™, or whatever reasoner provides the 
best reasoning capability for the domain.</p>
