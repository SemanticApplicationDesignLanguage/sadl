<p>The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is an important, widely used semantic 
modeling language. Models in OWL provide a robust foundation upon which semantic rules can be added to capture 
additional domain knowledge.</p>
<p>The Semantic Application Design Language (SADL) provides an English-like 
language for building 
semantic models and authoring rules. The SADL Integrated 
Development Environment (SADL-IDE) is 
an Xtext-based set of Eclipse plug-ins for editing, maintaining, and managing models, rules, tests, 
and queries expressed in SADL. By default the SADL-IDE uses the Jena 
reasoner/rules engine and a SADL to Jena translator to save models as OWL files 
and rules in Jena rule format. However, the SADL-IDE is designed to accept any 
translator/reasoner pair 
conforming to the SADL  plug-in architecture so models and rules can be saved to 
the required format for any target reasoner. This  permits applications to use whatever reasoner provides the 
best reasoning capability for the domain. Currently SWI-Prolog is available as a 
reasoner. Previous versions of SADL supported the Pellet reasoner.</p>
