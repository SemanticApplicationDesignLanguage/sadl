    <p>Inference is the process of deriving new statements, in the form of RDF
      Triples, from existing statements. In SADL models, inferences can be based
      on first order logic and set theory or it can be based on if-then rules in
      the SADL model. Drawing inferences of these two types must be integrated
      within the reasoner (the code that computes inferences) so that new
      statements from either source may be used to draw additional inferences of
      either type. Note that if-then rules can have effects other than adding
      triples. For example, an if-then rule might invoke a built-in function to
      print to the console window.</p>
