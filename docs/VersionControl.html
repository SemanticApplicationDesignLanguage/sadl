      systems (VCSs) typically track the changes in digital artifacts over time
      and by the source of the change. A modern version control system will
      manage creating branches of a project, showing the differences between
      branches, and merging branches. All of these capabilities are useful in
      the development and management of semantic models in SADL.</p>
    <p>The Eclipse environment in which the Eclipse-based SADL integrated
      development environment functions provides multiple version control or
      source code control systems, including SVN and Git, as integrated
      functionality. These VCSs can also be used as stand alone applications,
      either command-line or with graphical user interfaces. </p>
    <p>WebSADL has a tight integration with Git. For details see Using WebSADL
      with Git.</p>
    <p>Use of version control when developing and maintaining SADL projects is
      highly recommended!<br>
