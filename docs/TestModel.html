      &nbsp;<em>Test Model</em> is a user command that can be executed in the
      context of a selected SADL model file or in the context of a selected test
      suite file. The command can be activated from the menu bar's SADL dropdown
      menu when in the SADL perspective, as shown below.</p>

    <p><em>Test Model </em>may also be selected from the SADL tool bar icon.</p>

    <p>If the currently selected file in the IDE is a .sadl file, that file must
      contain at least one command statement, e.g., <em>Ask</em>, <em>Test</em>,
      etc. Upon execution of the <em>Test Model</em> commend on a valid SADL
      model, inference will be run on the model to create an inferred model. If
      the selected SADL model does not contain any command statements, an
      inferred model is not created. Once created, the inferred model is used to
      process the command statements, ie. to run queries, run tests, etc., with
      the results being displayed in the console window. The screen capture
      below shows a model with a <em>Test</em> statement and an <em>Ask</em>
      statement. The results of running <em>Test Model </em>are displayed in
      the console window.</p>

    <p>If the currently selected file in the IDE is a test suite (a .test file),
      the file should contain one or more <em>Test</em> statements with the URI
      of a SADL model as object of the test. The referenced SADL model should
      contain one or more <em>Test</em> statements. The screen capture below
      shows a test suite referencing three SADL models. The results of running
      Test Model is shown in the console window. Note that one test in the suite
      failed.</p>
