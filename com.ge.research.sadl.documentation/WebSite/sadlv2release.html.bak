<h3><a name="Version 2 Release History">Version 2 Release History</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Version 2.2.0 for Eclipse Kepler (using Xtext 2.4.3) released 3/5/2014 (<b><font color="#CC0000">Note 
  that Eclipse Kepler and Java 1.7 are required for this release.</font></b>)<ul>
  <li>Vocabulary for rules extended to support OWL constructs such as 
  restrictions (see&nbsp; <a href="KnownIssues.html">known issues</a>)</li>
  <li>Added support for qualified cardinality restrictions<ul>
    <li>&quot;... described by &lt;property&gt; with a single value of type &lt;class&gt;...&quot; 
    will be translated to an OWL 2 maxQualifiedCardinality restriction on the 
    described class of 1 for &lt;property&gt; with values of type &lt;class&gt; </li>
    <li>&quot;&lt;property&gt; of &lt;class1&gt; has exactly &lt;n&gt; values of type &lt;class2&gt;.&quot; will 
    be translated to an OWL 2 qualifiedCardinality restriction on &lt;class1&gt; of 
    &lt;n&gt; for &lt;property&gt; with values of type &lt;class2&gt; </li>
    <li>&quot;&lt;property&gt; of &lt;class1&gt; has at least &lt;n&gt; values of type &lt;class2&gt;.&quot; will 
    be translated to an OWL 2 minQualifiedCardinality restriction on &lt;class1&gt; of 
    &lt;n&gt; for &lt;property&gt; with values of type &lt;class2&gt; </li>
    <li>&quot;&lt;property&gt; of &lt;class1&gt; has at most &lt;n&gt; values of type &lt;class2&gt;.&quot; will 
    be translated to an OWL 2 maxQualifiedCardinality restriction on &lt;class1&gt; of 
    &lt;n&gt; for &lt;property&gt; with values of type &lt;class2&gt; </li>
    <li>Note that the Jena reasoner does not support qualified cardinality 
    restrictions but one can write validation rules to do so.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Built-ins greaterThan, lessThan extended to support strings</li>
  <li>Running of tests and queries is now a separate &quot;job&quot; so the main (UI) 
  thread is not blocked and so that run-away inferencing processes can be 
  canceled. (Go to the &quot;Progress&quot; view to see background operations, which can 
  be done by clicking on the greenish buttons in the very lower-right hand 
  corner of the Eclipse display. Then click on the red square to the right of 
  the background job to cancel.)</li>
  <li>Improved process for debugging difficult to understand issues, see
  <a href="#Debugging">below</a>. </li>
  <li>Test Suite editor </li>
  <li>Jena TDB repository option added to existing OWL flat file formats for 
  storage format </li>
  <li>Underlying DSL updated to Xtext 2.4.3 </li>
  <li>Underlying Jena updated to Apache Jena 2.11.2</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beta 21 release (2.1.9, 12/3/2112), for Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) with Xtext 
  2.1 <b><font color="#CC0000">(Note: a fresh Eclipse Indigo install followed by 
  adding the SADL plug-in is recommended. Otherwise some old libs appear to get 
  used and some misbehavior has been noted.)</font></b><ul>
  <li>The SADL-IDE now includes an Xtext-based editor for test suites (.test 
  files) with syntax checking, model name validation, and content-assist 
  (ctrl-space).</li>
  <li>OWL files may now be saved in RDF/XML, RDF/XML-ABBREV, N3, or N-Triple 
  format, as specified in preferences. (Project must be cleaned manually when 
  format is changed.)</li>
  <li>Added trigonometry built-ins: cos, sin, tan, acos, asin, atan.</li>
  <li>Added user control of automatic generation of rdfs:labels from URIs, which 
  are then indexed by Lucene for Lucene search. Use of this capability is 
  controlled via preferences. When enabled, a user-settable ILuceneModelIndexer 
  interface class, default provided, is used to provide indexing of the model.</li>
  <li>Variable assignment now supported in rule premises, e.g., &quot;x is 3.19&quot;, via 
  assign built-in</li>
  <li>Bug-fix: checking to see if an instance specified as subject or object value is in 
  the domain or range was failing to properly 
  consider the super-class tree.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beta 20 release (2.1.8, 7/26/2012), for Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)<ul>
  <li>Fixed errors in translating property ranges to OWL</li>
  <li>Added warning for multiple single-valued &quot;described by&quot; lines for a given 
  class and property (such does NOT create a qualified cardinality restriction, 
  which is only supported in OWL 2)</li>
  <li>Minor bug fixes to rule/query/test translation of junctions</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beta 19 release (2.1.7, 7/11/2012), for Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in some values from restrictions that caused restrictions in one 
  model on a class in an imported model to generate improper OWL files.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beta 18 release (2.1.6, 6/27/2012), for Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)<ul>
  <li>Fixed egregious error that caused edited model to not be updated</li>
  <li>Improved cleanup of closed resources, both models and projects</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beta 17 release (2.1.5, 6/21/2012), for Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)<ul>

  <li>Model names in content assist and quick fixes were missing the leading 
  &quot;http:&quot;</li>
  <li>The default configuration.rdf file placed in new projects was not properly 
  formed. Also default configuration file placed in existing project when 
  missing wasn't being read</li>
  <li>Sometimes discovered built-ins added to the configuration.rdf file were 
  not saved</li>
  <li>Rule file reading modified to not give erroneous error if a non-UTF8 
  character exists in the rule file</li>
</ul>

  <li>Fixed test translation to support all tests in TestSadlIde project, e.g., 
  tests that have &quot;is &lt;=&quot;.</li>
  <li>Fixed rule translation problems that resulted in truncated rule in Jena 
  when built-ins were nested inside of other built-ins.</li>
  <li>Import URI of the form &quot;<a href="file://somefile.sadl">file://somefile.sadl</a>&quot; 
  is deprecated; use SADL file name without prefix or else use model URI (there 
  is a quick fix for this; search for &quot;file://&quot; and use quick fix to update 
  import statement)</li>

  <li>Changed meaning of &quot;with a single value of&quot; in a class or property with 
  domain declaration to mean a max cardinality of 1 restriction on the class; 
  &quot;has a single value&quot; as a descriptor of the property indicates a functional

<ul>
  <li>Grammar and code improvements to support more complete testing (see TestSadlIde project 
  for lots of new test cases)<ul>
  <li>Consistency of triple syntax improved: there are three possible syntaxes 
  for a triple pattern in a test, rule, or query<ol>
    <li>subject [has|with] predicate object</li>
    <li>predicate of subject is object</li>
    <li>object is predicate of subject</li>
  </ol>
  Note that only the &quot;has&quot; or &quot;with&quot; in the first (SPV) syntax is optional. Note 
  also that &quot;is&quot; between the predicate and object of the first syntax is not 
  admitted.</li>
  <li>There are four kinds of tests:<ol>
    <li>Equality: a triple to be matched or a left-hand side, right-hand side, 
    e.g., &quot;a friend of Jimmy = a friend of Johnny&quot; (&quot;is&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, or &quot;= =&quot; can be 
    used between the parts; this test will pass if there is a match, even if one 
    or the other has other friends)</li>
    <li>Negation: &quot;not&quot; is added to the syntax, e.g., &quot;the spouse of George is 
    not Maggie&quot;, &quot;a friend of Jimmy is not a friend of Johnny&quot; (to pass there 
    must not be any friends in common)</li>
    <li>Strict Equality: &quot;only&quot; is added to the syntax, e.g., &quot;the spouse of 
    George is only Martha&quot;, &quot;a friend of Ruby is only {[Ruth], [Fanny], 
    [Margarita]}&quot; (to pass Ruby must have exactly these friends an no others)</li>
    <li>Negation of Strict Equality: &quot;not only&quot; is added to the syntax, e.g., &quot;a 
    friend of Ruby is not only Fanny&quot; (to pass Ruby must have more values of 
    &quot;friend&quot; than just Fanny)</li>
  </ol>
  Note that &quot;known&quot; is a valid object value for testing and rules. It may be 
  used for Equality and Negation, but not with &quot;only&quot;.
</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resolved more mapping issues</li>
  <li>Other bug fixes</li>
</ul>
  </li>

  preferences GUI (see <a href="JenaConfiguration.html">Jena Reasoner 
  Configuration</a> for an example)</li>
  <li>Jena Built-In functions no longer need to be configured. If they are 
  installed they will be discovered and available. A list of available built-ins 
  can be obtained within the context of a rule element by selecting the 
  &quot;built-in function..&quot; template from content assist (control-space).</li>

<h2><a name="InstallationInstructions2.2.0">Installation Instructions for SADL-IDE, 
Version 2.2.0 and Later</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>If not already installed, install Java 1.7 from
  <a href="http://www.java.com">http://www.java.com</a>&nbsp; (Java 1.7 required!). 
  (See <a href="#CheckJavaVersion">How to check Java Version</a>.) </li>
  <li>Download and install Eclipse Kepler (Eclipse Standard 4.3.x) from
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a> 
  . (Note: if unable to install the SADL update in the next step due to missing 
  requirements, install &quot;Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers&quot;, which will 
  include the Xtext dependencies which are most likely the problem.) </li>
  <li>Start Eclipse Kepler, go to Help -&gt; Install New Software. Click on Add... 
  to create the new update site with Location
  <a href="http://sadl.sourceforge.net/kepler/update/">
  http://sadl.sourceforge.net/kepler/update/</a> and whatever Name you wish. 
  Click OK to install SADL for GE. Select all features, accept the license 
  agreement, confirm installation and restart. </li>
  <li><b><font color="#ff0000">Note that the Eclipse workspace path must NOT 
  have any spaces or other non-URL compatible characters.</font></b> If needed, 
  switch to a different workspace on a valid (Unix-compatible) path (File -&gt; 
  Switch Workspace). </li>
  <li>The performance of the SADL-IDE is highly dependent upon the amount of 
  memory available to the application. If running in a 32-bit environment, the 
  memory available to the Java Virtual Machine is inherently limited to not much 
  more than 1 GB and may be less. On 64-bit machines with lots of memory, the 
  allocation to the JVM for Eclipse can be made much larger. To change the 
  maximum memory available, edit the &quot;eclipse.ini&quot; file in the &quot;eclipse&quot; folder 
  where you installed Eclipse. Change the line &quot;-Xmx512m&quot; (normal default 
  setting) to something larger, e.g., &quot;-Xmx4096m&quot; (64-bit) or &quot;-Xmx1024m&quot; 
  (32-bit). </li>
  <li>Optional: download the <a href="#DemonstrationProjects">demonstration 
  project TestSadlIde</a> to test SADL and provide examples of many knowledge 
  constructs. </li>

<h2><a name="Debugging">Debugging</a> Inference Problems</h2>
<p>To debug the SADL-IDE environment, use a log4j.properties file. A sample one 
may be downloaded from <a href="log4j.properties">here</a>. Change the output 
file as desired or switch to a ConsoleAppender. Add lines such as the last one 
in this file (without leading &quot;#&quot; comment indication) to control specific debug 
output. Place the properties file at some location, e.g.,
