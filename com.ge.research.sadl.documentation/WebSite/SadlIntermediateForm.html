<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The SADL Intermediate Form is an in-memory representation used to capture the 
semantics of graph patterns and functions used in SADL rules, queries, and 
tests. This in-memory representation serves several purposes.</p>
<ol>
  <li>It serves as the input to target reasoner-specific translators that then 
  convert rules and queries into the format required by the reasoner. For 
  example, a Jena-based reasoner requires that rules be expressed in Jena Rule 
  langiage and that queries be expressed in SPARQL. Hence a compatible 
  Jena-based translator will translate the intermediate form into Jena Rules and 
  SPARQL queries.</li>
  <li>It serves as the mechanism for capturing and preserving tests and other 
  SADL &quot;commands&quot; during model processing so that they can be processed during 
  inferencing of a SADL model.</li>
  <li>Expressions in the Intermediate Form can be serialized for examination by 
  users (the Explain command) and for automated testing.</li>
</ol>
