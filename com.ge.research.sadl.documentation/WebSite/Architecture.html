<p>The SADL language and SADL-IDE are used to build models which are both stored 
as SADL files and as OWL and Rule files. These files can (and should) be managed 
in a source control control repository, such as CVS. A selected reasoner/rule 
engine may be used to exercise and test models in the IDE. Once a set of models 
is ready for deployment as part of an application, the OWL and Rule files can be 
tagged for release and moved to a server environment where they are used by a 
reasoner/rule engine to receive instance data, infer results, and respond to 
queries from clients.</p>
