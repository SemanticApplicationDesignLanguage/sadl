The primary location for user access to SADL documentation remains on http://sadl.sourceforge.net. However, this project is the source of SADL 3 documenation. 
Please make all editing changes to this github folder, https://github.com/crapo/sadlos2/edit/development/sadl3/com.ge.research.sadl.parent/com.ge.research.sadl3.documentation. 
Documentation files, both HTML and images, can then be uploaded to sourceforge.net.
