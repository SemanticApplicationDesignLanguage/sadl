http://semanticapplicationdesignlanguage.github.io/sadl/ with older
documentation remaining on http://sadl.sourceforge.net/ and other
parts of the documentation appearing in the SADL wiki
(https://github.com/SemanticApplicationDesignLanguage/sadl/wiki/).

Going forward, please make all editing changes to documentation in the
gh-pages branch of this git repository,
https://github.com/SemanticApplicationDesignLanguage/sadl/tree/gh-pages/docs/.
Documentation files in the gh-pages branch, both HTML and images, will
