<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>WebSADL is a set of services that allow a SADL IDE to be instantiated in a 
Web browser. The functionality mirrors that of the Eclipse-based SADL IDE. 
WebSADL capabilities include the following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Authoring of SADL model (.sadl) files in a feature-rich text 
editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Live model  validation with error, warning, and information 
markers in the editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Generation (OWL, N3, and NT) from valid SADL models.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">LS-based semantic highlighting of content in the SADL 
editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hyperlinking between the SADL model concepts, both from 
references to declaration and to references.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Content assist in the SADL editor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Downloading and managing external OWL resources into 
the workspace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Preferences set via an editable JSON file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Testing, querying, explanation of SADL models.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Reviewing the output of any SADL model via Ask and Test 
statements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p class="MsoNormal">Collaboration with the Theia Git extension.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This document is primarily about using WebSADL in a browser. For more 
information about setting up the WebSADL backend services, please see
<a href="WebSadlBackend.html">WebSADL Backend</a>.</p>

<h2>Connecting to the WebSADL Backend</h2>

<p>The WebSADL client will run in a Web browser. Chrome is recommended and is 
the browser that has been used in testing.</p>

<p>Connect to the WebSADL backend by entering the service URL of the form 
&quot;http://&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;, e.g.,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://nsk1websadl01.crd.ge.com:3000">
http://nsk1websadl01.crd.ge.com:3000</a></p>

<p>The result should be a browser tab with menu items around content areas as shown below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>Using WebSADL</h2>

<h3>Creating a SADL Project</h3>

<p>To create a new SADL project, first make sure the&nbsp; Explorer is visible 
using the Explorer Toggle. Select a folder under which the new project is to be 
located and right-click to obtain a popup menu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="images/WebSAD7.gif" width="739" height="543"></p>

<p>Click on &quot;New SADL Project&quot; to create a SADL project. Name your project as 
requested. For purposes of this tutorial, you might want to name it &quot;Shapes&quot;. 
Note: SADL projects should not be nested within SADL projects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="images/WebSAD8.gif" width="636" height="198"></p>

<p>Note that in the new SADL project the &quot;settings.json&quot; file is 
created. This contains the project's 
preference settings and can be 
opened in an editor by  clicking on the name of the file in the Explorer.</p>

<h3>Creating SADL Model Files</h3>

<p>Now that we have a SADL project, we can begin to create SADL model files. 
Right-click on the project name (e.g., &quot;Shapes&quot;) and select &quot;New File&quot;. In the 
naming dialog give the file a name ending in &quot;.sadl&quot;, e.g., &quot;ShapesTop.sadl&quot;. 
The result will be a new SADL model file opened in a SADL editor window. This 
editor window will have content assist, error, warning, and info markers, hyperlinking, 
etc., just like the Eclipse-based SADL IDE. Holding down the Control key and 
pressing the space bar activates content assistance. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="images/WebSAD9.jpg" width="654" height="285"></p>

<p>Pressing the Enter key will insert the selected suggestion into the model 
file.</p>

<p>Defining a class &quot;Shape&quot; which is in the domain of property &quot;area&quot; with range 
&quot;float&quot; results in the following state of the project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="images/WebSAD10.jpg" width="739" height="509"></p>

<p>Note that an &quot;OwlModels&quot; folder has been created and contains the translated 
OWL file for our newly created model as well as several other files. The &quot;ImplicitModel&quot; 
folder contains the definition of the built-in functions supported by the 
selected reasoner. It also contains the SadlImplicitModel. These two editable 
files, along with SadlBaseModel.owl and SadlListModel.owl in the OwlModels folder, are implicitly 
imported by every SADL model. </p>

<p>To complete our simple demo project, we create a second SADL model file which 
imports the first and defines Circle and Rectangle as subclasses of Shape with 
defining properties. Finally we add a couple of rules to compute the area of 
these types of Shape.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>Search can be local to a particular file, in which case it can be initiated 
with <i>control-f</i> or <i>Edit -&gt; Find</i> on the menu bar. In either case, a 
popup allows text to be entered and arrows allow movement from one matching 
occurrence to the next. The in-file text search dialog can be dismissed by 
clicking on the &quot;x&quot; in the upper right corner. Find and replace within a file 
works similarly. Note that concepts should be renamed using the &quot;Rename Symbol&quot; 
popup menu choice to rename across all references in the project rather than 
with find and replace.</p>

<p>Searching the workspace is initiated with <i>Search icon </i>or with<i> control-shift-f </i>or<i> Edit 
-&gt; Find in Files.</i> The result will be the appearance of the Search tab on the 
left of the content area and a list of all of the matches to the entered string in the entire 
workspace. Each occurrence is a hyperlink which, if clicked, will open the file 
containing the match and highlight the matching text in that file. Icons near 
the text input box allow additional control of the search.</p>

<h3>Bottom Panel</h3>

<p>The bottom panel in the browser can contain any of several tabs. The bottom 
panel can be toggled in or out of view by clicking on the white rectangle at the 
right end of the bar at the bottom of the browser. The &quot;SADL&quot; before the 
rectangle indicates that the current language is SADL.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="WebSAD2.gif" width="80" height="21"></p>

<h4>Output</h4>

<p>The Output tab shows the results of running queries and testing models.</p>

<h4>Problems</h4>

<p>The &quot;Problems&quot; tab shows a list of errors and warnings hyperlinked to the 
location where each occurs. This tab is made visible by clicking on the errors 
or warnings icon on the status bar across the bottom of the browser window, as 
shown below.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><img border="0" src="WebSAD1.gif" width="80" height="24"></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The icons shown above indicate that there is 1 error and 38 warnings in the current 
workspace.</p>

<h4>Terminal</h4>

<p>The &quot;Terminal&quot; tab is a bash command window which can be used to do more 
complex git operations.</p>

<h3>Testing a Model</h3>

<p>We can test our model by creating a SADL file which contains some instances 
of Shape and some tests to verify that the rules compute correct areas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="images/WebSAD12.jpg" width="536" height="187"></p>

<p>By clicking on &quot;SADL&quot; in the menu bar and selecting &quot;Test Model&quot;, with the 
focus in the TestShapes.sadl editor, we can run inference. The results are displayed 
in the Output window and include the test results.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>Using WebSADL with Git</h2>

<p>Git can be set up on the server machine so that it uses the config 
information (e.g., user) from a local git repo which is the current directory or 
a parent thereof.</p>

<p>The &quot;Git&quot; tab on the left allows adding files to tracking and committing 
changes, as well as comparing a changed file with its head revision. </p>

<p>A terminal window opened up in the browser interface allows other git 
operations such as cloning, pushing.</p>

<p>The Git configuration on the server should be done by, so that the config 
file is in the same user home folder, the same user who starts the backend.</p>

<p>Any one who has access to the service through the browser interface can 
execute commands in the terminal window and any git actions affecting a remote 
repo will be done in the name of the local user of the current local git repo.</p>
