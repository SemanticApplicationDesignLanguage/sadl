<h2>Visualization in SADL Version 3</h2>
<p>In SADL Version 3, the graphing package is a plug-in accessed as a service 
implementing the Java Interface class<i> 
com.ge.research.sadl.model.visualizer.IGraphVisualizer. </i>The SADL-IDE SADL 
preference &quot;Graph renderer package and class&quot; setting is, by default, the 
GraphViz implementation in <i>
com.ge.research.sadl.model.visualizer.GraphVizVisualizer</i>. Any visualizer 
implementing the <i>IGraphVisualizer</i> Interface class can be placed on the 
Java classpath and specified in this preference.</p>
<h3>Generating Graphs with GraphViz</h3>
<p>GraphViz can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">
http://www.graphviz.org/</a> and should be placed on a path without spaces or 
other &quot;difficult&quot; path characters. Once installed, there should be a &quot;bin&quot; 
folder under the installation directory with &quot;dot&quot; and &quot;dotty&quot; executables.</p>
<p>GraphViz creates graphs as SVG files in the Graphs project subfolder. 
Generating a graph also results in an attempt to open the graph file using the 
application associated with the SVG file type in Eclipse. With an 
appropriate file association, graphs will automatically be opened in an 
appropriate viewer, e.g., a Web browser such as Chrome or the internal Web 
browser.</p>
<p>When the GraphVizVisualizer is used, the location of the GraphViz bin folder must be specified in the OS environment variable GraphVizPath, e.g, </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GraphVizPath<i>=C:\Apps\graphviz-2.36\release\bin</i></p>
<p>Also, when the GraphVizVisualizer is used, the dot file can be retained (not 
automatically deleted after the SVG file is created) by setting the OS 
environment variable GraphVizKeepDot to true:  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GraphVizKeepDot =true.</p>
<p>Note that Eclipse must be restarted after setting environment variables for them 
to become visible to Eclipse. (For some reason, a reboot has been found to be 
necessary to make the environment variable visible in Eclipse.)</p>
<h3>Graph Generation Options</h3>
<p>There are two basic graphing commands available on the SADL dropdown menu: 
&quot;Show Graph&quot; and &quot;Graph Ontology&quot;. (In the SADL perspective, &quot;SADL&quot; appears in the top menu 
bar; the SADL (gear) icon on the tool bar also has this dropdown menu.) </p>
<h4>Show Graph</h4>
<p>The result of &quot;Show Graph&quot; depends upon what is selected before invoking the 
command. The answer to the &quot;How many edges from anchor?&quot; question will determine 
the size of the graph generated around the &quot;anchor&quot; concept or model.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="49%">
  <tr>
    <td width="44%"><b>Selected Object Given Focus</b></td>
    <td width="56%"><b>Results</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="44%">A SADL model file, either selected in the Project Explorer 
    or because the focus is in the editor window where the SADL model is open, 
    but nothing is selected in the editor</td>
    <td width="56%">A graph of imports of the selected SADL model</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="44%">A class is selected in the SADL editor</td>
    <td width="56%">Two graphs, a class hierarchy including the class and 
    domains and ranges that include the class</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="44%">A property is selected in the SADL editor</td>
    <td width="56%">A graph showing the domain and range of the property, and 
    extending on following domains and ranges</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="44%">An instance is selected in the SADL editor</td>
    <td width="56%">A graph showing all of the connections of that instance in 
    the graph</td>
  </tr>

<h4>Graph Ontology</h4>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="50%">
  <tr>
    <td width="43%"><b>Selected Object Given Focus</b></td>
    <td width="57%"><b>Results</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="43%">A SADL file selected in the Project Explorer</td>
    <td width="57%">A graph of the model contained in the SADL file</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="43%">A SADL project selected in the Project Explorer</td>
    <td width="57%">A graph of the project showing models as nodes and arcs 
    showing imports</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Graphing options include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a class in SADL editor window, invoke &quot;Show Graph&quot;: two graphs are 
  generated, class hierarchy and domains and ranges</li>
  <li>Select a property in SADL editor window, invoke &quot;Show Graph&quot;: a domains 
  and ranges graph is generated</li>
  <li>Select an instance in SADL editor window, invoke &quot;Show Graph&quot;: an instance 
  graph is generated</li>
  <li>Select a file in the Project Explorer window, invoke &quot;Show Graph&quot;: a graph 
  showing what the selected file imports and what imports it is displayed</li>
</ol>
<p>Graphs can also be generated from SADL statements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ask: &quot;construct ....&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // will generate a graph for a 
  valid SPARQL construct statement (see
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct">
http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct</a> )</li>
  <li>Graph: &quot;select ?s ?p ?v where {....}&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // will construct 
  a graph; requires a result with 3 columns</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
