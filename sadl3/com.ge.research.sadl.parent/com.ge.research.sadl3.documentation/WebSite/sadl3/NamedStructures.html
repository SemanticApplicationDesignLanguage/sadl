<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The majority of the SADL language is designed to provide a controlled-English 
representation of OWL semantics. This portion of the grammar allows the modeler 
to create OWL classes and then to create instances of those classes. However, 
SADL also supports the creation of non-OWL structures including rules, queries, 
and tests. Sometimes these structures are given names in the SADL model. This is 
always the case with rules. In SADL 3 it is an option for queries. When a SADL 
structure is given a name, it becomes desirable to make it a linked object in 
the SADL model and an instance in the resulting OWL model. For example, give two 
rules, <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i>, it might be desirable to&nbsp; add an annotation 
to the first indicating some relationship to the second. In the SADL model this 
means that <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i> should be hyperlinked. In the resulting OWL 
model this requires that the first be a instance so that it can become the 
subject of an annotation statement, and that the second also be an instance in 
the model so that it can become the object of the annotation statement. </p>
<p>Another example of a named structure and how it can be used is that of a 
named query. One might define the query <i>Q1</i> in one model, e.g., </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">Ask</font><font SIZE="2">
</font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000ff"><b>Q1</b></font><font SIZE="2">: </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#008000"><b>area</b></font><font SIZE="2">.</p>
</font>
<p>and then wish to use the same query in another model, e.g., </p>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask</font><font SIZE="2">: </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000ff"><b>Q1</b></font><font SIZE="2">.</font></p>
<p>This would be particularly useful for complex queries that one wished to be 
able to exercise in multiple places. </p>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The SADL Version 3 implicit model, SadlImplicitModel.sadl located in the 
project's ImplicitModel folder, defines by default two implicit classes. Note 
that <i>Rule</i> is escaped with a caret because it is a reserved word in the 
grammar.</p>
<blockquote>
  <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000080"><b>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">^Rule</b></font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
  <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">is</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
  <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">a</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
  <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">class</font><font SIZE="2">.</font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000080"><b><br>
  NamedQuery</b></font><font SIZE="2"> </font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">is</font><font SIZE="2">
  </font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">a</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
  <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">class</font><font SIZE="2">.</p>
  </font>
</blockquote>
<p>The names of named structures in the Xtext grammar are now treated as scoped 
and linked concepts. These named concepts can become the subject or object of 
statements in the model. When a named structure is processed to generate the OWL 
model, an individual of the appropriate implicit model class is created. This 
individual is then used as subject or object of any RDF triples created from 
statements in the SADL model. This means that one can now query the model for 
information about named structures.</p>
<p>Note that instances of named structures are the same blue as regular 
instances but are bolded to make them identifiable. </p>
<p>Note also that named structures can be given annotations using the same 
syntax as annotations for classes, instances, and properties, but with the 
annotation property a user-defined property instead of &quot;alias&quot; or &quot;note&quot;.</p>
