<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The &quot;there exists&quot; construct in SADL merits special explanation. This 
construct can only appear in the conclusion of a rule. It is related to 
existential quantification, that is reasoning about what must exist.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that we define the class <i>Parent</i> as a <i>Person</i> 
who has at least 1 <i>child</i>:</p>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000080"><b>Person</b></font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">is</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">a</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000080"><b>Parent</b></font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">only</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">if</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#008000"><b>child</b></font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">has</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">at</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">least</font><font SIZE="2"> 1 </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">value</font><font SIZE="2">.</p>
</font>
<p>If we encounter an instance definition such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000ff">Eve</font><font SIZE="2">
</font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">is</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">a</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000080"><b>Parent</b></font><font SIZE="2">.</p>
</font>
<p>then we know, given that the range of <i>child</i> is <i>Person</i>, that 
there must exist an instance of <i>Person</i> who is the <i>child</i> of <i>Eve</i>. 
The &quot;there exists&quot; construct allows us to reason in if-then rules about 
scenarios in which such existence can be inferred, even&nbsp; if we don't know 
the name (URI) of the <i>Person</i> in question.</p>
<h2>About Identity of Blank Nodes</h2>
<p>As noted in ??, OWL does not require that graph nodes be given unique 
identity with a URI. Rather OWL permits that unnamed instances (or classes) be 
identified by their relationships with other things and/or their innate 
properties. The question arises as to how much must be known about these 
relationships and/or properties to uniquely identify the concept, to distinguish 
this one concept from all others, or at least all others in a given context.</p>
<p>The combination of properties that uniquely identify an instance is sometimes 
referred to as the &quot;primary key&quot;. For example, given that a Parent may have more 
than one child, how much information must be known about an unnamed instance of 
Person to </p>
<p>The context matters as more or less information is needed to ensure unique 
identification in different contexts. For example, in a world where a <i>Parent</i> 
can only have 1 child, knowing the identity of the <i>Parent</i> would be 
sufficient to uniquely identify the child. In a world where twins are not 
possible, knowing the identity of the <i>Parent</i> and the birthdate of the 
child would be sufficient.</p>
<h2>Triple Patterns and There Exists</h2>
<p>When &quot;there exists&quot; is used in the conclusion of a rule, the domain ontology 
and conditions of the rule create a context for the existence reasoning. Any 
additional conditions for uniquely identifying an instance satisfying the &quot;there 
exists&quot; must be explicitly stated. In addition, the rule may add additional 
information to the inferred model which is not part of the uniquely identifying 
criteria. Consider this example. Suppose we have this simple domain model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now imagine that we wish to express two rules, one that adds commentary to 
children of smart parents and one that adds commentary to wealthy parents. Of 
course the Parent of a particular child might be both smart and wealthy, so the 
commentary is not part of the unique identification criteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that if the scenario data already contains Person instances that match 
the criteria, that is they are the child of a Parent, then the rule will fire 
for each matching instance. However, if there are no pre-existing instances of 
Person with a child relationship to the Parent, then one will be created, 
associated with the Parent per the criteria, and the commentary added. Given no 
pre-existing match to a given Parent, which ever of the two rules fires first 
will create the instance of Person and the second rule will find and use this 
instance, adding the conclusions commentary.</p>
