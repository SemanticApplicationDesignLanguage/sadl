<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The &quot;there exists&quot; construct in SADL merits special explanation. This 
construct can only appear in the conclusion of a rule. It is related to 
existential quantification, that is, reasoning about what must exist.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that we define the class <i>Parent</i> as a <i>Person</i> 
who has at least 1 <i>child</i>:</p>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000080"><b>Person</b></font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">is</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">a</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000080"><b>Parent</b></font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">only</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">if</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#008000"><b>child</b></font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">has</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">at</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">least</font><font SIZE="2"> 1 </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">value</font><font SIZE="2">.</p>
</font>
<p>If we encounter an instance definition such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000ff">Eve</font><font SIZE="2">
</font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">is</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">a</font><font SIZE="2"> </font>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#000080"><b>Parent</b></font><font SIZE="2">.</p>
</font>
<p>then we know, given that the range of <i>child</i> is <i>Person</i>, that 
there must exist an instance of <i>Person</i> who is the <i>child</i> of <i>Eve</i>. 
However, inference over OWL entailments will not create an instance. The &quot;there 
exists&quot; construct allows us to create if-then rules to do reasoning about 
scenarios in which such existence can be inferred.</p>
<h2>About Identity of Blank Nodes</h2>
<p>As noted in ??, OWL does not require that graph nodes be given unique 
identity with a URI. Rather OWL permits unnamed instances (or classes) be 
identified by their relationships with other things and/or their innate 
properties. The question arises as to how much must be known about these 
relationships and/or properties to uniquely identify the concept--to distinguish 
this concept from all others, or at least all others in a given context.</p>
<p>The combination of properties that uniquely identify an instance is sometimes 
referred to as the &quot;primary key&quot;. For example, given a rule in which, for a 
given <i>Parent</i>, we wish to identify a <i>child</i> of that <i>Parent</i>, 
how much information must be known about the unidentified instance of <i>Person</i> 
which is the child in order to find or create the <i>Person</i> of interest that 
is known to exist?</p>
<p>The context matters as more or less information is needed to ensure unique 
identification in different contexts. For example, in a world where a <i>Parent</i> 
can only have 1 child, knowing the identity of the <i>Parent</i> would be 
sufficient to uniquely identify the child. In a world where twins are not 
possible, knowing the identity of the <i>Parent</i> and the birth date of the 
child would be sufficient. Or perhaps in the context of a rule it is sufficient 
simply to identify a <i>Person</i> who is a <i>child</i> of the <i>Parent</i>.</p>
<h2>Triple Patterns and There Exists</h2>
<p>When &quot;there exists&quot; is used in the conclusion of a rule, the domain ontology 
and conditions of the rule create a context for the existence reasoning. Any 
additional conditions for uniquely identifying an instance satisfying the &quot;there 
exists&quot; must be explicitly stated. In addition, the rule may add additional 
information to the inferred model which is not part of the uniquely identifying 
criteria. If there is no instance in the data that matches the criteria, we do 
not want to create one unless the rule conditions are all met. For this reason, 
the &quot;there exists&quot; is only legal in the rule conclusion. The actual 
implementation of this functionality is in a single built-in function named &quot;thereExists&quot;. 
The arguments of the function fall into 3 categories.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The type (class) of the instance that must be found or created</li>
  <li>A set of triple patterns to which the instance to be found or created must 
  conform</li>
  <li>An optional set of triple patterns that are to be added to the instance 
  but which are not part of the criteria for finding or creating the instance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider this example. Suppose we have this simple domain model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now imagine that we wish to express two rules, one that adds <i>commentary</i> 
to children of smart parents and one that adds <i>commentary</i> to children of 
wealthy parents. Of course the <i>Parent</i> of a particular child might be both 
smart and wealthy or neither one, so the <i>commentary</i> is not part of the 
unique identification criteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that if the scenario data already contains <i>Person</i> instances that 
match the criteria, that is they are the <i>child</i> of a <i>Parent</i>, then 
the rule will fire for each matching instance. However, if there are no 
pre-existing instances of <i>Person</i> with a <i>child</i> relationship to the
<i>Parent</i>, then one will be created, associated with the <i>Parent</i> per 
the criteria, and the commentary added. Given no pre-existing match to a given
<i>Parent</i>, which ever of the two rules above fires first will create the 
instance of <i>Person</i> and the second rule will find and use this instance, 
adding the conclusions <i>commentary</i>.</p>
