<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Traditionally knowledge has been captured in some kind of knowledge 
development interface which is akin to an integrated development environment 
(IDE) for software development. For example, the SADL IDE is a knowledge capture 
or knowledge development interface. Usually such an interface is not well-suited 
to fielding the knowledge base in the environment in which it is useful either 
as part of a software solution or as a decision support tool to people working 
to solve problems. For delivery, the knowledge base is often more usefully 
exposed through some kind of programmatic interface in which specific scenario 
data is passed to a knowledge service, inference is perhaps performed, and 
questions are asked to expose both the knowledge, the scenario data, and the 
inferences drawn for this particular scenario. </p>
<p>The knowledge services described herein are divided into three levels of 
service: 
1) basic scenario data push, query pull, 2) basic plus the ability to make 
modifications to the knowledge base and persist both knowledge base changes and 
data pushed (persist and edit, PE), and 3) basic plus PE plus a number of 
convenience methods that facilitate model-driven (MD) applications. </p>
<p>The names of the knowledge server Java Interface classes for each level of 
service is shown in the table below.</p>

<p>This document will provide information and links to more detailed information 
for the services provided by each of these three classes. Each class in the 
table is linked to the JavaDoc documentation for that class. Complete JavaDoc 
for the knowledge server Java API is available at <a href="JavaDoc/JavaAPI/index.html">
Java API classes</a>.</p>
<h2><i>ISadlServer</i>: Basic Services via a Java API</h2>
<h3>Outline of Usage: Initial Steps</h3>
<h4>Creation</h4>
<p>The first step is to create an instance of a class implementing <i>
ISadlServer</i>, e.g., <i>SadlServerImpl</i>. This is done with a Java statement 
of the form:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; ISadlServer srvr = new SadlServerImpl( );</i></p>
<h4>Initialization</h4>
<p>Next the server must be initialized by setting the folder on the file system 
that is the kbase root folder, meaning all kbases are located under this folder. 
This can be done by calling <i>setKbaseRoot</i>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>srvr.setKbaseRoot(&quot;c:/someuser/kbaseroot&quot;);</i></p>
<p>Note that this could have been done in a single call by passing the kbase 
root to the constructor:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>&nbsp; ISadlServer srvr = new SadlServerImpl( &quot;c:/someuser/kbaseroot&quot;);</i></p>
<h3>Outline of Usage: Next Steps</h3>
<p>Once an instance of a class implementing <i>ISadlServer</i> has been created 
an initialized, subsequent method calls can occur in any order. Functionalities 
of potential interest are described in this section.</p>
<h4>Pushing Scenario Data from Client to Server</h4>
<h2>Sending Data to the Service</h2>
<p>A Knowledge Server knowledge base consists of a set of
<a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">OWL</a> models. An OWL model consists of a set 
of RDF triples. Scenario-specific information can be added to a knowledge base 
by adding RDF triples to the knowledge base. There are multiple ways that data 
can be added to the server's knowledge base. Note that the services defined by
<i>ISadlserver</i> only allow adding data for the current server session; the 
data is not persisted on the server.</p>
<h3>Creating a New Instance of a KBase Class</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>String newInstanceURI = srvr.createInstance(&quot;http://some/scenario/namespace/uri#newInstanceName&quot;, 
&quot;http://some/kbase/namespace/uri#ExistingClassName&quot;);</i></p>
<h3>Adding a Triple to the KBase</h3>
<p>An RDF triple consists of a subject, a property (or predicate), and a value. 
The value can be a literal if the property is an <i>owl:DatatypeProperty</i>, or 
it can be a URI if the property is an <i>owl:ObjectProperty</i> (see
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-guide-20040210/#SimpleProperties">
https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-guide-20040210/#SimpleProperties</a>). Thus 
for an owl:DatatypePropety one might have this call:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>boolean status = srvr.addTriple(&quot;http://some/uri#subjectInstanceName&quot;, 
&quot;http://some/kbase/uri#someDatatypePropertyName&quot;, 23.56);</i></p>
<p>For an owl:ObjectProperty, one would make this call:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>boolean status = srvr.addTriple(&quot;http://some/uri#subjectInstanceName&quot;, 
&quot;http://some/kbase/uri#someObjectPropertyName&quot;, &quot;<a href="http://some/uri#objectInstanceName">http://some/uri#objectInstanceName</a>&quot;);</i></p>
<h3>Using SPARQL Update</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/">SPARQL</a> is a W3C graph 
query language. SPARQL 1.1 includes
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-update-20130321/">update 
capability</a>. The ISadlServer interface includes a method to insert triples 
into and/or delete triples from the server session's knowledge base using an 
update statement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>srvr.query(&quot;delete {?person &lt;foaf:givenName&gt; 'Bill'} 
insert {?person &lt;foaf:givenName&gt; 'William'} where {?person &lt;foaf:givenName&gt; 
'Bill'}&quot;);</i></p>
<h3>Loading a File Containing RDF Triples</h3>
<p>Data can be loaded into the knowledge base from a file containing RDF triples 
in several standard formats, e.g., XML, Notation3 (N3), N-Triples (see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework#Serialization_formats">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework#Serialization_formats</a>). 
The caveat is that the file designation is on the server's file system and must 
be known by the client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>boolean status = srvr.loadData(&quot;file:///c:/tmp/instdata1.owl&quot;);</i></p>
<h3>Loading a File containing Comma Separated Values (CSV)</h3>
<p>With the additional information provided by a template file, RDF triples can 
also be added to the session kbase from a CSV file. Once again, file paths are 
on the server file system and must be known to the client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>boolean status = srvr.loadCsvData(file:///c:/tmp/instdata1.csv&quot;, 
true, &quot;<a href="file:///c:/kbases/mykbase/mytemplate.tmpl">file:///c:/kbases/mykbase/mytemplate.tmpl</a>&quot;);</i></p>
<p>The 3rd argument could be a URL or it could be an actual template as a 
String.</p>
<h3>Sending Data from a Client File Containing RDF Triples</h3>
<p>If a file on the client file system contains RDF triples, the data can be 
sent to the server using the class <i>
<a class="header" href="eclipse-javadoc:â??=com.ge.research.sadl.sadlserver-impl/C:\/Program%20Files\/Java\/jdk1.8.0_77\/jre\/lib\/rt.jar%3Cjavax">
javax</a>.<a class="header" href="eclipse-javadoc:â??=com.ge.research.sadl.sadlserver-impl/C:\/Program%20Files\/Java\/jdk1.8.0_77\/jre\/lib\/rt.jar%3Cjavax.activation">activation</a>.DataSource</i> 
or one of its subclasses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>DataSource fdsrc = new FileDataSource(file:///c:/tmp/instdata1.owl);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boolean status = srvr.sendData(fdsrc);</i></p>
<h3>Sending Data from a Client CSV File</h3>
<p>A client-side CSV file can also be sent, along with a template, to add 
triples to a session's knowledge base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>DataSource fdsrc = new FileDataSource(file:///c:/tmp/instdata1.csv);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boolean status = srvr.sendCsvData(fdsrc, true, &quot;<a href="file:///c:/kbases/mykbase/mytemplate.tmpl">file:///c:/kbases/mykbase/mytemplate.tmpl</a>&quot;);</i></p>
<p>In this case the 3rd argument could be an URL or it could be the actual 
template as a String.</p>
