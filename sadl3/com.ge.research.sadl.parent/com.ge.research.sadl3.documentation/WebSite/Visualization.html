<h2>SADL Version 2</h2>
<p>The SADL-IDE Version 2.2.0.201411111033 and later includes the ability to 
visualize &quot;neighborhoods&quot; of a concept (class, property, or individual) as a 
graph. For classes, two graphs are generated: a class hierarchy graph and a 
property domains and ranges graph. This visualization capability uses GraphViz 
and must be configured as described below. When properly configured, the graphs 
are displayed in a separate window. A corresponding PNG image file is also 
created in the project's Temp folder.</p>
<p>SADL-IDE versions after April, 2015 include the ability to see the import 
tree of any file. Right-click on the target SADL file in the Project Explorer 
and select &quot;Sadl Actions&quot; -&gt; &quot;Graph Imports&quot;. The result will be a graph of 
imports with the selected model as the highlighted node.</p>
<p>GraphViz can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">
http://www.graphviz.org/</a> and should be placed on a path without spaces or 
other &quot;difficult&quot; path characters. Once installed, there should be a &quot;bin&quot; 
folder under the installation directory with &quot;dot&quot; and &quot;dotty&quot; executables.</p>
<p>In SADL Version 2, the SADL-IDE is configured to use GraphViz by opening global preferences 
(Window -&gt; Preferences) . Click on &quot;Sadl&quot; in the left-side menu. The global 
preferences will include, at the bottom, &quot;GraphViz bin folder&quot;. Fill in the path 
to the bin folder of your installation, e.g., &quot;<a href="file:///C:/win32app/graphviz/release/bin">C:\win32app\graphviz\release\bin</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>A neighborhood can now be graphed by opening a model in the SADL editor and 
selecting the entire text of a concept name, then right-clicking for a context 
menu and selecting &quot;Graph Neighborhood&quot;. </p>
<p>Note that arbitrary graphs can also be created with the &quot;Ask: construct...&quot; 
directive in a SADL model. (See
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct">
http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct</a>.) If graphing is configured, 
the result of the SPARQL 
construct will be displayed as graph using GraphViz as described above.</p>
<h2>SADL Version 3</h2>
<p>In SADL Version 3, the graphing package is a plug-in accessed as a service 
implementing the Java Interface class<i> 
com.ge.research.sadl.model.visualizer.IGraphVisualizer. </i>The SADL-IDE SADL 
preference &quot;Graph renderer package and class&quot; setting is, by default, the 
GraphViz implementation in <i>
com.ge.research.sadl.model.visualizer.GraphVizVisualizer</i>. Any visualizer 
implementing the <i>IGraphVisualizer</i> Interface class can be placed on the 
Java classpath and specified in this preference.</p>
<p>Graphs are created as SVG files in the Graphs project subfolder. With an 
appropriate file association, they will automatically be opened in an 
appropriate viewer, e.g., a Web browser.</p>
<p>When the GraphVizVisualizer is used, the location of the GraphViz bin folder 
(see above) must be specified in the OS environment variable GraphVizPath, e.g, </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GraphVizPath<i>=C:\Apps\graphviz-2.36\release\bin</i></p>
<p>Also, when the GraphVizVisualizer is used, the dot file can be retained (not 
automatically deleted after the SVG file is created) by setting the OS 
environment variable GraphVizKeepDot to true:  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GraphVizKeepDot =true.</p>
<p>Note that Eclipse must be restarted after setting environment variables for them 
to become visible to Eclipse. (For some reason, a reboot has been found to be 
necessary to make the environment variable visible in Eclipse.)</p>
<p>Graphs can be generated by selecting either &quot;Show Graph&quot; or &quot;Graph Ontology&quot; 
from the Dropdown Menu. (In the SADL perspective, &quot;SADL&quot; appears in the top menu 
bar; the SADL (gear) icon on the tool bar also has this dropdown menu.) Graphing 
options include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a class in SADL editor window, invoke &quot;Show Graph&quot;: two graphs are 
  generated, class hierarchy and domains and ranges</li>
  <li>Select a property in SADL editor window, invoke &quot;Show Graph&quot;: a domains 
  and ranges graph is generated</li>
  <li>Select an instance in SADL editor window, invoke &quot;Show Graph&quot;: an instance 
  graph is generated</li>
  <li>Select a file in the Project Explorer window, invoke &quot;Show Graph&quot;: a graph 
  showing what the selected file imports and what imports it is displayed</li>
</ol>
<p>Graphs can also be generated from SADL statements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ask: &quot;construct ....&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // will generate a graph for a 
  valid SPARQL construct statement (see
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct">
http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct</a> )</li>
  <li>Graph: &quot;select ?s ?p ?v where {....}&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // will construct 
  a graph; requires a result with 3 columns</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
