<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>A variable in SADL is a name which is not defined in the ontology but is used 
in expressions (in triple patterns or as built-in function arguments) as 
a uniquely identified placeholder. (See
<a href="http://sadl.sourceforge.net/sadl3/FoundationalConcepts.html#Graphs">
Graph Patterns</a>.) Variables tie together multiple triple patterns and/or 
built-in function patterns to allow complex queries, rules, tests, etc., to be 
constructed. Note that SADL variables do not exist in the semantic model, the 
declaration of what exists. Variables only exist in expressions in queries, 
rules, etc. To illustrate, consider these statements in context.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the ontology, &quot;X is a Person&quot; means that &quot;X&quot; is an instance of the 
  class &quot;Person&quot;.</li>
  <li>In a query, &quot;X is a Person&quot;, as in &quot;select X where X is a Person&quot; means 
  find all possible values for the variable &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;X is a Person&quot; is 
  true.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="VariablesSADL3">Variables in SADL 3</a></h2>
<p>Model processing in SADL 3 makes much greater use of the functionality of 
Xtext. One such use of Xtext is in cleaner, simpler handling of variables. 
Variables in SADL are local in scope--a variable is only defined within the 
context of a rule, query, or test. If another rule, query, or test in the same 
SADL file has a variable of the same name, it is a different, independent 
variable. Xtext scoping differentiates between the declaration of a name, 
including a variable, and references to that name. This enables the hyperlinking of &quot;Open Declaration&quot; and &quot;Find References&quot; to easily go from 
references to declaration and vice versa. Xtext also can identify the type of a 
name, e.g., class, property, variable, necessary for semantic coloring to work. Variables 
pink bold. Therefore, Xtext scoping can be leveraged in the model processor to 
create a SADL VariableNode (class com.ge.research.sadl.model.gp.VariableNode) 
when the declaring parse tree element is processed. The newly created VariableNode is given, using the Xtext information, a type. Note that no type 
checking is needed for a variable declaration since the declaration defines the 
type.</p>
<p>In addition to a variable's declaration and references, we introduce the 
additional concept of a variable's definition. Suppose that &quot;X&quot; is a variable 
and its declaration is either of the following forms.</p>
<ol>
  <li>X is a Person with age 23</li>
  <li>a Person with age 23 is X</li>
</ol>
<p>In either case, the variable &quot;X&quot; is defined to be &quot;a Person with age 23&quot;. In 
some extension grammars and/or some target translations instances of &quot;X&quot; may be 
replaced by the definition. For this reason the model processor records such 
definitions in the VariableNode.</p>
<p>Information stored in a VariableNode comes from multiple sources and must be 
maintained in such a way that no information is lost. A variable may be declared 
in expressions in several ways.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In a declaration without any additional information, e.g., &quot;x is a 
  Person&quot;. This results in creation of a VariableNode instance during 
  BinaryOperation &quot;is&quot; processing, the variable name on the left and a 
  Declaration on the right. Here the declaration provides the type of the 
  variable, e.g., &quot;Person&quot; and the SADL expression provides a definition, &quot;rdf(x, 
  rdf:type, Person)&quot;.</li>
  <li>In a declaration with additional information, e.g., &quot;x is a Person with 
  age 23&quot;. In this case the type of the variable is &quot;Person&quot; but the definition 
  is more complex: &quot;and(rdf(x, rdf:type, Person), (x, age, 23))&quot;.</li>
  <li>In a declaration in which the left and right sides of statements such as 
  those in 1 and 2 are swapped, e.g.,<ul>
    <li>a Person is x</li>
    <li>a Person with age 23 is x</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>By use in a SubjHasProp graph pattern as the subject or as an object, 
  e.g., &quot;x has age y&quot;. If and only if &quot;x&quot; is not already declared then this is 
  the declaration of &quot;x&quot; and the type of the VariableNode is obtained from the 
  ontology, specifically from the domain of &quot;age&quot; although extension languages 
  could provide additional constraining information about the type of &quot;x&quot;. 
  Likewise, if and only if &quot;y&quot; has not already been declared, this triple 
  pattern is the declaration of &quot;y&quot; and the type of the VariableNode is obtained 
  from the ontology. In this case it could, if &quot;x&quot; was declared elsewhere, come 
  from a property restriction for property &quot;age&quot; on the class to which &quot;x&quot; may 
  be bound. At a minimum, the type of &quot;y&quot; might be obtained from the range of 
  &quot;age&quot;. <b><font color="#FF0000">In any of these cases, is there a definition? 
  &quot;is(x,rdf(x, age, y))&quot;? &quot;is(y,rdf(x,age,y))&quot;?&nbsp; I think not--no definition 
  in this case as the variables are simply used and from their usage we get a 
  type. TBD.</font></b></li>
  <li>By use in a PropOfSubject graph pattern, e.g., &quot;age of x is y&quot;. In this 
  case, if and only if &quot;x&quot; is not already declared, the type of &quot;x&quot; is the 
  domain of &quot;age&quot; and the Variable Node for &quot;x&quot; is created while processing the 
  PropOfSubject expression. (Again, extension languages might provide local 
  restrictions that would narrow the type of &quot;x&quot;.) If and only if &quot;y&quot; is not 
  already declared elsewhere, this statement is the declaration of &quot;y&quot; and the 
  type of the VariableNode is obtained from the ontology, either from local 
  restrictions of an extension language, from property restrictions on the class 
  which is the type of &quot;x&quot;, or from the range of &quot;age&quot;. In this case the 
  VariableNode for &quot;y&quot; is created while processing the BinaryOperation &quot;is&quot; with 
  the PropOfSubject on the left and the variable name on the right. <b>
  <font color="#FF0000">In any of these cases, is there a definition? &quot;is(x,rdf(x, 
  age, y))&quot;?&nbsp; &quot;is(y,rdf(x,age,y))&quot;?&nbsp; I think not--no definition in 
  this case as the variables are simply used and from their usage we get a type. 
  TBD.</font></b></li>
</ol>
<p>Translation to Intermediate Form may capture information that seems redundant 
with VariableNode declaration but is not. If the variable declaration in the 
SADL model includes a declaration, as in 1, 2, and 3 above, then that definition 
is stored in the VariableNode for possible use by downstream processing, e.g., 
for variable substitution. However, it is also stored as triple pattern(s) and 
functional (built-in) pattern(s) in the Intermediate Form. This is necessary to 
maintain the order of patterns in the original SADL representation. The model 
author may have explicitly placed the patterns in a particular order and while 
an optimizing translator may change that order, the job of the Intermediate Form 
is to preserve all information, including order. </p>
<h2><a name="CRules">Implicit Variables (CRules)</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to use definite and indefinite articles with class names to 
tie graph patterns together instead of using explicit variables in SADL rules, 
queries, etc. This is the same way that English makes connections between 
phrases and sentences. This approach to writing graph patterns is sometimes 
referred to as Concept Rules or CRules.</p>
<p>In the Intermediate Form, a triple for the type of the implicit variable is 
not included because this information is already in the VariableNode and the 
translator from Intermediate Form to the final representation can add the type 
triple where it deems appropriate.</p>
