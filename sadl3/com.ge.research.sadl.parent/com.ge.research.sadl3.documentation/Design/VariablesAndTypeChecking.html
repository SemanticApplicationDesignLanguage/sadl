<p>Model processing in SADL 3 makes much greater use of the functionality of 
Xtext. One such use of Xtext is in cleaner, simpler handling of variables. 
Variables in SADL are local in scope--a variable is only defined within the 
context of a rule, query, or test. If another rule, query, or test in the same 
SADL file has a variable of the same name, it is a different, independent 
variable. Xtext scoping differentiates between the definition of a concept, 
including a variable, and references to that concept. This allows the &quot;Open 
Declaration&quot; hyper linking from references to declaration to work. Xtext also 
can identify the type of a name, necessary for coloring of variables pink, etc. 
Therefore, Xtext scoping can be leveraged in the model processor to create a 
SADL VariableNode (class com.ge.research.sadl.model.gp.VariableNode) when the 
defining parse tree element is processed. The newly created VariableNode is 
given, using the Xtext information, a type and definition. Note that no type 
checking is needed for a variable definition since the definition defines the 
type.</p>
