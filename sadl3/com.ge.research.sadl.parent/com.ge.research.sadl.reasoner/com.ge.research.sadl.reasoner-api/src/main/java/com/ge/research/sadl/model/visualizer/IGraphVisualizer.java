 * The type of graph supported by this visualizer interface is a directed graph consisting of nodes and edges.
 * For a discussion of various serialization formats, see
 * 		https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.02781.pdf
 * 		
 * The following capabilities are needed to support the obvious graphing needs 
 *  of ontologies:
 *  - Nodes with text descriptions
 *  - Directed edges
 *  - Edges labeled
 *   
 * In addition, descriptive information for each node and/or edge label may be included, e.g., 
 *  how to color the edge, how to color or shape the node.
