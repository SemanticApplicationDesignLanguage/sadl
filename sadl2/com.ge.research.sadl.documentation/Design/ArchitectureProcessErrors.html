<h1>SADL Architecture, Translation, Execution, and Error Handling</h1>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<h2>Translation, Execution, and Error Handling</h2>
<p>The process of translating a SADL model into an OWL model happens in several 
distinct phases. </p>
<ol>
  <li>When a model is loaded from a SADL file or when the modeler edits a model, 
  the SADL expressions are parsed by the Xtext (ANTLR) parser. This may result 
  in errors because the model statements do not comply with the grammar of the 
  language. If the SADL file is open, these errors are reported by putting error 
  markers in the Xtext editor.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>The parse tree created by the parser is processed by calls to the 
  SadlModelManager. SadlModelManager translates parse tree nodes into instances 
  of the classes belonging to the Intermediate Form (IF). The IF classes are 
  generally found in the com.ge.research.sadl.model and 
  com.ge.research.sadl.model.gp packages. Some additional errors may be 
  discovered during this translation to IF.</li>
  <li>SadlModelManager passes the IF structures in calls to ModelManager. 
  ModelManager uses this information to generate an OWL model defining classes, 
  properties, instances, and triple statements. ModelManager also organizes 
  certain IF structures to store rules and lists of queries, tests, and other 
  SADL commands. At this point the OWL model, IF rules, etc. are only in memory. 
  Calls to ModelManager may detect important errors as this is the first step at 
  which semantics and not just syntax is checked. For example, it might be 
  detected that an instance is given two values for a functional property.</li>
  <li>When the saved, the OWL model and the IF rules are passed to the IF 
  Translator (implementation of ITranslator). The Translator saves the model and 
  rules in the appropriate form for the target Reasoner. For example, if the 
  target Reasoner (implementation of IReasoner) is Jena, the OWL model is simply 
  written as an OWL model and the rules are translated to Jena rules and saved 
  in a rule file with the same base name as the OWL model file but with &quot;.rules&quot; 
  instead of &quot;.owl&quot; as the file extension. Errors generated at this phase will 
  normally relate to the translation to the target representation. For example, 
  an error would be generated if a built-in function is used in a rule but is 
  not known to Jena reasoner (not in the configuration).</li>
  <li>A model may contain test and/or queries which can be executed via the Test 
  Model command or a modeler may query the model interactively through the Run 
  Query command. In either case, the target reasoner is instantiated via the 
  ConfigurationManager and and the inferred model is used to evaluate the tests 
  and queries. Additional errors may occur and be reported. The results of 
  executing tests and queries, along with any errors encountered, are generally 
  reported with messages to the console window. Where appropriate, these 
  messages are hyperlinked to the SADL model file statement containing the test 
  or query. Errors at this stage are not generally related to translation but to 
  model content.</li>
