<h1>SadlBuilder, ConfigurationManager, SadlModelManager, and ModelManager</h1>
<h2>Working with SadlBuilder</h2>
<p>The title classes must work together efficiently and with Jena's OntModel to 
allow the IDE to achieve it's functional objectives. This has proven to be a 
difficult part of the SADL-IDE to get right in version 2, and moving to Eclipse 
3.7, Xtext 2.1 has not made the issues go away.</p>
<p>SadlBuilder appears to be multi-threaded (?). Editors appear to each have 
their own thread(?).</p>
<p>There appears to be only one instance of SadlModelManager(SMM) used by all. 
However, we need a ModelManager (MM) for each model being edited/built. Hence 
the SMM keeps track of MMs by thread (SMM.getModel()).</p>
<p>It was discovered that cleaning a Jena OntModel and reusing it leads to all 
kinds of leftover baggage such as prefix mappings. Therefore, when a MM is 
initialized if the Resource is not the same as the last Resource, a new Jena 
OntModel is created. Should the old OntModel be forcibly removed?</p>
<p>If an instance of MM keeps all the model-specific stuff, then only a single 
ConfigurationManager should be needed per project. Note that Xtext will 
sometimes call JavaValidator, which uses ConfigurationManager, without any 
context. However, I think we can assume that the project is the same as the last 
call.</p>
<p>Getting the names in a namespace for Xtext (resolver, validator, etc.) has 
been partially moved to ConfigurationManagerForIDE as many calls will happen for 
models for which there is no MM but there is an OWL model in the Jena model 
cache. This seems to work well.</p>
<p>A big issue seems to be whether to create a new Jena OntModel on each 
initialization of MM or clean up the existing one by removing all content. Doing 
the former may cause a lot of memory to be waiting for garbage collection? But 
would the latter be much better? Just saving the OntModel structure itself? And 
besides, it may be the case that the former OntModel is useful to have in the 
cache as other models may import it... When to clear a model from the cache is a 
separate and somewhat independent issue I think. Perhaps what is needed is, 
after a build or when an editor window closes, to call &quot;close()&quot; on any OntModel 
not in the dependency list of an open editor window's model.</p>
<p>Cleaning model, now that I can do it (ConfigurationManagerForIDE.clearJenaModelContent(model)) 
results in errors.</p>
<h2>Working with Editors</h2>
<p>Threads do not appear to be the reliable way to associate a MM with a URI.</p>
<p>SMM gets called from these places:</p>
<ol>
  <li>getConfigurationMgr(modelFolder) -- there is a ConfigurationManger for 
  each URI (model folder). Called from SadlJavaValidator.checkImport, 
  SadlResourceNameTemplateVariableResolver.resolveValues(),</li>
  <li>build-dependency -- this doesn't need to build a complete model, just get 
  the imports; calls SMM.init, then doSwitch until all imports are found..</li>
  <li>build-resource -- this needs to build a complete OntModel as this model is 
  then written to disk as the OWL file; call is to SMM.processModel (complete).</li>
  <li>semantic highlighting -- this is called each time a change is made to the 
  model in the editor so the complete OntModel should be built so that errors 
  will be detected and marked. Call is to SMM.processModel.</li>
  <li>getNamedConceptsInNamedModel -- call is from JeanResource.doLoad (SadlGlobalScopeProvider); 
  first a call to get the names and then a call to validateConceptName for each 
  name to get its type.</li>
  <li>getModelImportMappings -- call is from SadlGlobalScopeProvider.getScope, 
  which calls createJenaScope, which results in the call above for each model? 
  </li>
  <li>getAltUrl -- call is from SadlImportUriResolver.resolve, 
  SadlJavaValidator.checkModelName, </li>
  <li>getPendingError(name) -- call from SadlJavaValidator to get and report 
  errors</li>
  <li>getNamedConceptsOfType(type) -- called from 
  SadlProposalProvider.completeResourceByName_Name to give a list of possible 
  names for the context, called by SadlResourceNameTemplate after processing 
  parser results</li>
  <li>getModelResource() -- to help find the appropriate preferences, from 
  multiple locations</li>
  <li>setImportListType() -- to say whether import suggestions will be files or 
  URIs</li>
  <li>called from RunQuery, TestModel, TestSuite</li>
</ol>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<ol>
  <li>build-dependency does not need to call SMM--it can just get dependencies 
  from the parse tree and then stop iterating</li>
  <li>validateStatement was taking a huge amount of time so added preference 
  deepValidationOnBuild, deepValidation field in MM (<b><font color="#FF0000">not 
  yet connected</font></b>)</li>
  <li><b><font color="#FF0000">TODO</font></b>: only import defaults.owl if it 
  is used in the model.</li>
  <li>Once the imports section of a model is past, the imports will be 
  unchanging and can be cached (importsAndPrefixes in MM).</li>
  <li>Efficiency at finding names would be improved by keeping an ordered list 
  of namespaces with the most fruitful first</li>
  <li>Is it ever the case that we want the MM retained in SMM after the call to 
  end()?</li>
  <li><b><font color="#FF0000">ToDo:</font> </b>Need to replace model on editor 
  close without save on changed model and unload so that any unsaved changes 
  will be gone.</li>
  <li>Circular imports (TestSadlIde) seem to have gone awry. The idea is to 
  remove the submodel of the imported model loaded from OWL so that the current 
  model created from the SADL can be used instead ??</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the day, a single run with and without deep validation ran a 
complete build on InScope in 159,591 ms and 158,669 ms, respectively. So I think 
things are better...</p>

<h3>1/4/2011: Ready for 2.0.0 Release?</h3>
<p>Found out how to determine if an editor is open on a Resource, which lead to 
adding a listener for when it closed to SHC. </p>
<p>OWL to SADL fails on manufacturability files in known area of problems--any 
restrictions that are compound or complex.</p>
