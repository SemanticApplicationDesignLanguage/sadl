<h2>
Aliases</h2>
<p>
An OWL model can import other OWL models, which can import other OWL models, 
etc. This owl:imports functionality is critical to modularity and model reuse. 
In SADL we will assume that each separate SADL model will have its own unique 
XML namespace, which is specified as the first non-comment line in a SADL 
file--the &quot;uri&quot; statement.<p>
One of the benefits of using XML namespaces is the non-uniqueness of names; the 
same name in different namespaces is unambiguously different. However, for names 
which appear in different namespaces to be specified unambiguously in SADL they 
must be referred to in some way that disambiguates the namespace. This is done 
through the use of namespace prefixes or aliases as we will call them in SADL.

<p>
There are two ways of specifying the alias that corresponds to a particular 
namespace. The prefix may be specified for the entire project by including it as 
part of the declaration of the model name on the first statement in the model. 
For example:<blockquote>
  <u><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">
  <p>uri</font><font SIZE="2"> <b>&quot;http://com.ge.research.sadl/decl1&quot;</b> </font>
  <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">alias</font><font SIZE="2"> decl1. </p>
  </font></u>
</blockquote>
<p>
The other way specifies a local alias for use only in the importing model. 
(Since SADL doesn't support multiple namespaces in a single model file an alias 
is only needed if a model imports multiple models with the same XML name 
fragment or local name.) This is done as part of the import statement:<blockquote>
  <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">import</font><font SIZE="2"> <b>&quot;http://com.ge.research.sadl/decl1&quot;</b>
  </font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">as</font><font SIZE="2"> d1. </p>
  </font>
</blockquote>
<h2>
Import Management</h2>
<p>
Imports in the development (IDE) environment will use Jena to actually do the imports and 
will create an "ont-policy.rdf" file in the OwlModels folder which will contain an RDF 
model of imports. This file will contain the mapping between a model name (publicURI) and the actual location 
(altURL) of the model. Mappings are project-specific. The SadlModelManager will 
keep track of the mappings for each open project using a project-specific Jena 
LocationMapper.

<p>
In a new project or in a SADL Version 1 project loaded for the first time into 
Version 2, a template &quot;ont-policy.rdf&quot; file is copied to the project's OwlModels 
folder when it is found not to exist. At this time all SADL files in the project 
are scanned to determine their model name (publicURI) and their altURL is 
determined from the SADL file name and the OwlModels folder location. A project 
clean will also update all mappings of SADL models in the project in the 
ont-policy.rdf file. This establishes an initial valid condition for all 
mappings of SADL models and this information is used for all imports of models 
by other models in the project. When a valid SADL model is saved, the OWL model 
equivalent of the SADL model is saved to the OwlModels folder. Unless the model 
is without a name, which is an error condition, the mapping information for the 
OWL model is known at save time. This mapping information is passed to the 
ConfigurationManagaerForIDE instance for the current project. The 
ConfigurationManagerForIDE does two things: 1) updates the project's 
LocationMapper with the new information, and 2) updates the ont-policy.rdf file. 
The new information could be an entirely new mapping or it could be the change 
in a model's name (publicURI) or a change in a model's file name (altURL). If 
both are changed before a model is saved an old mapping may be left in the 
LocationMapper and in the ont-policy.rdf file, which will be removed on the next 
project clean. Entries in the ont-policy.rdf file for OWL files generated from 
SADL models will contain the "createdBy" property with value &quot;SADL&quot;. This allows 
us to clean up obsolete SADL model mappings as we will be able to detect a 
mapping for which there is no longer a valid file.<p>
One important difference between the SADL use of 
the ont-policy.rdf mapping file and normal Jena use is that the actual file URLs of SADL-generated OWL 
models will be used by ConfigurationManager only to determine the name of the OWL file. The
path to the file will be the same as the actual location of the ont-policy.rdf file itself.
This allows the OwlModels folder to be moved from one location to another without the need
to edit the ont-policy.rdf file. Of course the &quot;altURL&quot; values of other OWL models used but not 
created by the SADL-IDE will need to be edited if the resources are moved. 
Consequently, the Jena document manager's setMetadataSearchPath method is never 
used as it would load the mappings directly from the ont-pollicy.rdf file to a 
LocationMapper without correcting the altURL entries for the current location of 
the OwlModels folder. Instead, the ConfigurationManager loads the mappings from 
the ont-policy.rdf file into the project's LocationMapper and subsequent calls 
to the ConfigurationManagerForIDE keep the mappings up-to-date.<p>
In a SADL-IDE environment, a SADL model may be edited and saved, creating a new OWL model
while an importing SADL model file is open. To manage updating of imported models, a timestamp
will be created and remembered when an import is processed. The next time the import is 
processed, e.g., at the re-parsing of the open SADL file, the last-modified date of an 
imported model will be compared to this timestamp and if necessary the imported file will
be removed from the Jena model cache and reloaded.
