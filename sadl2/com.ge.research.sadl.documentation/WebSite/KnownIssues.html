<title>Known Issues in SADL</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Known Issues in the Latest Release of SADL</h1>
<p>Known issues in 2.2.0</p>
<ol>
  <li>Project-specific settings appear to not work correctly if the SADL project 
  already exists in an Eclipse workspace from an earlier version of the SADL-IDE. 
  Create a.new workspace and perhaps a new project and copy files over. This 
  problem is not yet completely understood. </li>
  <li>While OWL concepts are supported in rules in general, there is an 
  unresolved issue with owl:sameAs. </li>
  <li>Full-text search is not working. Jena LARQ has been replaced with Apache 
  Jena Text, which has not yet been incorporated into SADL. </li>
</ol>
<p>Known isues in 2.1.x.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The rule translator will sometimes incorrectly convert a test for equality 
  to an assignment if the rule premise elements are joined by &quot;and&quot;. Workaround: 
  don't use &quot;and&quot; to join rule premise patterns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Known issues in 2.1.3 (Beta 16) and above.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The quick fix to add an &quot;alias&quot; to a model name fails silently. This 
  appears to be a bug in Xtext, the IDE suite used for the SADL-IDE.</li>
</ol>
<p>Known issues in 2.1.2 (Beta 15)</p>
<ol>
  <li>While the build process, especially on project clean, is much more robust 
  in terms of building all resources in the right order of dependency, there is 
  an issue in large projects that is not well-understood that&nbsp; causes the 
  build to slow down. Consultants from itemis have been asked for help in 
  resolving this issue.</li>
  <li>Timing information for testing is not being shown and is not properly 
  controlled by the preference for showing timing.</li>
  <li>Some quick fixes that use templates are not working with Xtext 2. Awaiting 
  Xtext help on this issue as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>Known issues in 1.0.25 (Beta 10):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Templates, content assistance, and quick fixes are still a work in progress. 
  In particular, not all documentation and templates are updated to reflect the 
  use of global aliases.</li>
  <li>Error messages generated during build (as opposed to when a file is open 
  in the editor and saved) do not go to the IDE console. To see if there are 
  build errors start Eclipse with the <i>-console</i> option.</li>
</ol>
<p>Known issues in 1.0.20 (Beta 5):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Duplicate SADL file names (different folders) only reported to separate 
  console window (see last item below). Duplicate model URIs not always detected 
  and reported.</li>
  <li>Mapping issues remain requiring project clean and/or exit of Eclipse to 
  cause imports to&nbsp; be correctly resolved.</li>
  <li>Templates, content assistance, and quick fixes are still a work in progress.</li>
  <li>Error messages generated during build (as opposed to when a file is open 
  in the editor and saved) do not go to the IDE console. To see if there are 
  build errors start Eclipse with the <i>-console</i> option.</li>
</ol>
<p>Known issues in 1.0.17 (Beta 2):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Same as 1.0.16 (Beta 1), plus</li>
  <li>Jena built-in &quot;print&quot; only outputs to command console (run with 
  -console)--output to the IDE console not yet implemented</li>
</ol>
<p>Known issues in 1.0.16 (Beta 1):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Switching projects may still cause problems. If anomalous behavior is 
  observed please report. Workaround is to close and reopen Eclipse after 
  closing the previous project.</li>
  <li>Templates, content assistance, and quick fixes are still a work in progress. 
  However, you can add your own--see&nbsp;
  <a href="tutorial/DomainTemplates.html">Domain-Specific Templates</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Known issues in 1.0.13 (alpha 13):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Templates, content assistance, and quick fixes are still a work in progress.</li>
  <li>Error messages generated during build (as opposed to when a file is open 
  in the editor and saved) do not go to the IDE console. To see if there are 
  build errors start Eclipse with the <i>-console</i> option.</li>
</ol>
<p>Known issues in 1.0.11 (alpha 11):&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Templates, content assistance, and quick fixes are not complete in their 
  coverage. They are a work in progress.</li>
  <li>When switching to a different Eclipse project, it is recommended to close 
  Eclipse after closing the old project and before doing operations in the new 
  project.</li>
</ol>
<p>The release 1.0.8 (alpha 8). Know issues include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Templates, content assistance, and quick fixes are not complete in their 
  coverage. They are a work in progress.</li>
  <li>Conversion to errors in translating models to OWL to editor markers is not 
  complete. Some errors go unreported making it difficult to determine that an 
  error occurred and the details of the problem. Note that starting Eclipse with 
  &quot; -console&quot; on the command line will display a console window in which error 
  messages may be displayed and provide insight into problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Turning on Logging Output</h2>
<p>To turn on debug or other logging output to gather more information about a 
problem or to debug a custom built-in, one can specify the Logback configuration 
file by setting the property &quot;logback.configureationFile&quot; on the command-line 
when starting Eclipse. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java <b>-Dlogback.configurationFile=/path/to/config.xml</b></p>
<p>See <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html">
http://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html</a> for more details.</p>
