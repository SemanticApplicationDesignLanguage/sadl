<p>Modeling as a science has greatly benefited from the computational 
capabilities of the Information Age and has steadily evolved over the past 
several decades. The development of the Object Modeling Technique (OMT) at GE 
Research (<a href="#Rumbaugh">1</a>,<a href="#Lorensen">2</a>) and its evolution 
into the Unified Modeling Language (UML) was a significant milestone. No less 
significant was the work in description logics (DL) and artificial intelligence, 
which produced the Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF), the Resource Description 
Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL), conceptual graphs (CG), and 
Common Logic (CL). More recent work by the Object Management Group (OMG) has 
produced the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) and its variants, which promise to unify 
UML, OWL, and any other modeling language or paradigm (OMG’s MOF). This is an 
exciting time to be involved in modeling!</p>
<h2>Common Building Blocks</h2>
<p>&nbsp;UML was born in the software engineering domain. OWL and CL were born in the 
domain of formal models and logical inference and classification. It is 
instructive to compare their meta-models. MOF, first and foremost the meta-model 
of UML, captures four main concepts: 1) classes, 2) associations, 3) datatypes, 
and 4) packages. OWL models are composed of 1) classes, 2) properties, and 3) 
instances. The alignment is, however, much closer than it may appear. The MOF 
architecture has the meta-meta-model or MOF model at layer M3 with UML (for 
example) at layer M2, an actual UML model at layer M1, and the real-world data 
at layer M0 (see Figure 1). This M0 real-world data is a software engineer’s 
version of what an ontologist would call instances. </p>

<p>Datatypes exist in OWL as well as in MOF and represent those primitive data 
constructs that are not unique “instances” of a class. To illustrate, if John 
has brother Jim and Susan has husband Jim, then (assuming the same Jim) we would 
have only one instance of Jim in our model and both statements would reference 
it. However, if John has age 12 years and Susan owns 12 apples, we would not 
normally say that there is only one number 12 in our model. A datatype allows us 
to use things like numbers, strings, dates, etc. (XML Schema datatypes) without 
giving them a unique identifier. </p>
<p>In OWL, concepts (classes, properties, and instances) are identified by a 
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) (except for “blank class nodes” which are 
identified by a system-generated unique identifier for proper local handling). A 
URI consists of two parts: a namespace and a local name, separated by a “#” 
symbol. In this way local names are only required to be unique within the 
namespace. MOF 2 moves in the direction of making identifiers more compatible 
with OWL by requiring package names to be legal URIs. This makes sense since the 
concept of a namespace is in many ways similar to the package in MOF. Class 
names are only required to be unique within the package. Closely related classes 
will normally be found in the same package just as closely related concepts in 
OWL will normally be defined in the same namespace. In summary, the basic 
building blocks of MOF and of OWL are very similar. MOF metamodels of OWL have 
been constructed under work on the Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM) (ref OMG 
ODM). Automatic translation of at least most of UML and OWL models from one to 
the other is a work in-progress.</p>
<h2>Differences between UML and OWL</h2>
<p>There are some fundamental differences between UML and OWL (<a href="#ODM">3</a>). 
They include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>While both UML and OWL are based on sets, the set semantics of UML are not 
  as complete as are those of OWL</li>
  <li>In OWL an individual can exist and may have properties independent from 
  membership in any classes. This is particularly an issue when starting from 
  individuals with properties and doing classification to determine to which 
  classes they belong</li>
  <li>In UML there is not as much care taken to ensure that the semantics are 
  sufficiently followed to support automatic inference<ol>
    <li>UML disjointedness requires that disjoint classes have a common 
    super-class, which is not the case in OWL (other than every class is a 
    subclass of owl:Thing)</li>
    <li>Modeling set intersection in UML allows an instance of all the 
    super-classes to be omitted from the subclass</li>
    <li>There is no UML construct for set complement</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>UML lacks a formal model theoretic semantics; OCL has neither a formal 
  model theory nor a formal proof theory. This prevents the use of automated 
  reasoners on UML models</li>
</ol>
