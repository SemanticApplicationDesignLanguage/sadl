<h1>Importing OWL Files into a SADL Model</h1>

<h6>Last revised  <!--$date=-->2010-03-12<!--$--> by <a

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>SADL exists to help create models expressed in the Web Ontology Language
(OWL). Of course the idea is that we will reuse models rather than reinvent
them where ever possible. Obviously SADL should support the reuse of existing
OWL models. In the modular world of the Semantic Web, reusing an OWL model
means to import the model, extend it as necessary by adding or refining
concepts or by adding rules, and then exercise the model for some purpose.</p>

<h2>Namespace Versus Location</h2>

<p>When a model is persisted in a file, whether the file be a SADL model or an
OWL model, there are two concepts at play. First, what is the default or base
namespace of the model. This is the namespace that a concept is assumed to be
in if a namespace isn't explicitly stated. The second is the location of the
file--the actual URL from which the file content can retrieved.</p>

<p>You will recall that in a SADL model, the namespace of the model is the
first statement in the model. Here are the name statements from two models:</p>
<font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uri</font><font SIZE="2"> <b>
&quot;http://sadl.imp/Exercise10t&quot;</b>.</p>
</font>

<p>The location of SADL model is the location of the file. Since the file is a
resource in an Eclipse project, we can specify the location in a relative
manner, making it easy for a project to be moved to other locations and used by
other people. Obviously the location of a file should not be contained within
the file itself. When a SADL model imports another SADL model the file name
(the relative location rather than the namespace) of the imported model is used
to identify it. Here's the namespace and the import statement from a model that 
imports &quot;http://sadl.imp/Exercise10t&quot;:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">uri</font><font SIZE="2">
<b>&quot;http://sadl.imp/Exercise10a&quot;</b>.</font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080"><font SIZE="2"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>import</font><font SIZE="2">
<b>&quot;file://Exercise10t.sadl&quot;</b> </font><font SIZE="2" COLOR="#800080">as</font><font SIZE="2">
<b>Exercise10t</b>.</p>

</font>

<p>However, once translated to OWL both the importing model and the imported model will be identified by  namespace, not  location, 
in the importing model. The import above, in OWL RDF/XML, looks like this:</p>

<font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;owl:Ontology rdf:about=&quot;http://sadl.imp/Exercise10a&quot;&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;owl:imports rdf:resource=&quot;http://sadl.imp/Exercise10t&quot;/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/owl:Ontology&gt;</p>
</font>

<h2>Importing OWL into SADL</h2>

<p></p>

<p>It is expected that an OWL file will probably not exist
inside of a SADL Eclipse project, or if it does that it is only a copy of the file placed there
for convenience, e.g., to make it accessible even if network connectivity is
not available. With this anticipation, when we import an OWL model into a SADL 
model, we will reference the imported model by its namespace URI. Note that the 
namespace URI may or may not correspond to an actual URL from which content can 
be retrieved. The missing piece is the mapping from namespace URI to actual 
location. Since the SADL-IDE uses the Jena Framework, we will use the Jena 
mechanism to accomplish this mapping.</p>

<p>In Jena terminology, the namespace URI is sometimes called the &quot;publicURI&quot; 
whereas the actual location is called the &quot;altURL&quot;. Jena captures the mapping 
between the two, along with some additional information, in an RDF format in a 
file named, by default, &quot;ont-policy.rdf&quot;. If you are importing OWL models into 
your SADL models, you will need to place an &quot;ont-policy.rdf&quot; file in the 
OwlModels project folder and provide an &quot;OntologySpec&quot; for each OWL model you 
wish to import.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the OWL model whose publicURI is &quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/time">http://www.w3.org/2006/time</a>&quot;. 
The necessary segment of the ont-policy.rdf file in the OwlModels folder will 
look like this:</p>
<font SIZE="2">
<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;OntologySpec&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;altURL 
rdf:resource=&quot;file:///D:/testsadl/sadl/eclipse/workspace/SemanticsForSmartGridModels/OtherOwlAltUrl/time.owl&quot;/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;language 
rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl&quot;/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;publicURI 
rdf:resource=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2006/time&quot;/&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/OntologySpec&gt;</p>
</font>

<p>The altURL must be altered for any specific application to reflect the actual 
location of the file on the host filesystem. Note that the publicURI does NOT 
change but is a property of the referenced model itself.</p>
