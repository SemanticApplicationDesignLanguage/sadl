<p>This document describes the built-in functions for use in Jena rules that are 
included as a part of the SADL Open Source release, along with information on 
how to use them in the SADL language.</p>
<p>When using Jena-provided built-ins, it is important to understand the 
difference between the Jena syntax (see &quot;Builtin Primitives&quot; at
<a href="http://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/#RULEbuiltins">
http://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/#RULEbuiltins</a> ) and the SADL syntax. In 
the actual Jena rule created from the SADL rule, which is what is shown in the 
Jena documentation at the link above, if an assignment of the result is made to 
a variable, that variable will be the last argument to the actual built-in. In 
SADL syntax, the assignment is shown explicitly to be the variable on the left 
of the &quot;=&quot; or &quot;is&quot; assignment or implicitly as a nesting of terms. This is 
illustrated below for the <i>sum</i> built-in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Actual Jena syntax: <i>sum(?b, ?c, ?d) </i>means add ?b and ?c and assign 
  the value to ?d </li>
  <li>SADL explicit assignment: <i><font color="#ff00ff"><b>d</b></font> = sum(<font color="#ff00ff"><b>b</b></font>,
  <font color="#ff00ff"><b>c</b></font>)</i> or <i><font color="#ff00ff"><b>d</b></font> 
  is sum(<font color="#ff00ff"><b>b</b></font>, <font color="#ff00ff"><b>c</b></font>)
  </i>means the same: add&nbsp; b and c and assign to d </li>
  <li>SADL implicit assignment: <i><font color="#008000"><b>cost</b></font>
  <font color="#800080">of</font> <font color="#ff00ff"><b>z</b></font>
  <font color="#800080">is</font> sum(<font color="#ff00ff"><b>b</b></font>,
  <font color="#ff00ff"><b>c</b></font>)</i> means add b and c and assign as the 
  value of the cost property of z (additional variables are created in the 
  translation from SADL to Jena Rules) </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if built-ins combine operations they can hide important 
dependencies from the Jena Rule Engine. For example, if one built-in creates a 
structure (a set of triples) and another uses the structure, the Rule Engine may 
not detect that the structure must be built by one rule or set of rules before 
it can be used by another. The solution to this problem is to always work with 
the individual elements, not with larger structures. To this end, <i><u>
getDataValue</u></i>, <i>getInstance</i>, and <i>update</i> can be used together 
to do interesting things--see ShapesComplex example.</p>
<p>A table of Jena Built-Ins Available in the Open Source Version of SADL is 
shown below. The package name for all of these is &quot;com.ge.research.sadl.jena.reasoner.builtin&quot;. 
To make the table more readable, only the class name is shown. However, in 
registration references the entire fully-qualified class name must be specified.</p>

<p>Several of these built-ins have special syntax in SADL. These include the 
following.</p>
<ol>
  <li>NoValue (Jena built-in): p of x is unknown, p of x is not v</li>
  <li>NoValuesOtherThan: p of x is only y</li>
  <li>NotOnlyValue: p of x is not only y</li>
</ol>
