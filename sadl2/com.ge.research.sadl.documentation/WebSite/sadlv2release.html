<ul>
  <li>Version 2.2.0.2015051358 for Eclipse Kepler (using Xtext 2.43.) released 
  2/5/2015<ul>
  <li>Ontologies now have annotations</li>
  <li>User-defined data types supported</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Version 2.2.0 for Eclipse Kepler (using Xtext 2.4.3) released 3/5/2014 (<b><font color="#CC0000">Note 
  that Eclipse Kepler and Java 1.7 are required for this release.</font></b>)<ul>
  <li>Vocabulary for rules extended to support OWL constructs such as 
  restrictions (see&nbsp; <a href="KnownIssues.html">known issues</a>)</li>
  <li>Added support for qualified cardinality restrictions<ul>
    <li>&quot;... described by &lt;property&gt; with a single value of type &lt;class&gt;...&quot; 
    will be translated to an OWL 2 maxQualifiedCardinality restriction on the 
    described class of 1 for &lt;property&gt; with values of type &lt;class&gt; </li>
    <li>&quot;&lt;property&gt; of &lt;class1&gt; has exactly &lt;n&gt; values of type &lt;class2&gt;.&quot; will 
    be translated to an OWL 2 qualifiedCardinality restriction on &lt;class1&gt; of 
    &lt;n&gt; for &lt;property&gt; with values of type &lt;class2&gt; </li>
    <li>&quot;&lt;property&gt; of &lt;class1&gt; has at least &lt;n&gt; values of type &lt;class2&gt;.&quot; will 
    be translated to an OWL 2 minQualifiedCardinality restriction on &lt;class1&gt; of 
    &lt;n&gt; for &lt;property&gt; with values of type &lt;class2&gt; </li>
    <li>&quot;&lt;property&gt; of &lt;class1&gt; has at most &lt;n&gt; values of type &lt;class2&gt;.&quot; will 
    be translated to an OWL 2 maxQualifiedCardinality restriction on &lt;class1&gt; of 
    &lt;n&gt; for &lt;property&gt; with values of type &lt;class2&gt; </li>
    <li>Note that the Jena reasoner does not support qualified cardinality 
    restrictions but one can write validation rules to do so.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Built-ins greaterThan, lessThan extended to support strings</li>
  <li>Running of tests and queries is now a separate &quot;job&quot; so the main (UI) 
  thread is not blocked and so that run-away inferencing processes can be 
  canceled. (Go to the &quot;Progress&quot; view to see background operations, which can 
  be done by clicking on the greenish buttons in the very lower-right hand 
  corner of the Eclipse display. Then click on the red square to the right of 
  the background job to cancel.)</li>
  <li>Improved process for debugging difficult to understand issues, see
  <a href="#Debugging">below</a>. </li>
  <li>Test Suite editor </li>
  <li>Jena TDB repository option added to existing OWL flat file formats for 
  storage format </li>
  <li>Underlying DSL updated to Xtext 2.4.3 </li>
  <li>Underlying Jena updated to Apache Jena 2.11.2</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beta 21 release (2.1.9, 12/3/2112), for Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo) with Xtext 
  2.1 <b><font color="#CC0000">(Note: a fresh Eclipse Indigo install followed by 
  adding the SADL plug-in is recommended. Otherwise some old libs appear to get 
  used and some misbehavior has been noted.)</font></b><ul>
  <li>The SADL-IDE now includes an Xtext-based editor for test suites (.test 
  files) with syntax checking, model name validation, and content-assist 
  (ctrl-space).</li>
  <li>OWL files may now be saved in RDF/XML, RDF/XML-ABBREV, N3, or N-Triple 
  format, as specified in preferences. (Project must be cleaned manually when 
  format is changed.)</li>
  <li>Added trigonometry built-ins: cos, sin, tan, acos, asin, atan.</li>
  <li>Added user control of automatic generation of rdfs:labels from URIs, which 
  are then indexed by Lucene for Lucene search. Use of this capability is 
  controlled via preferences. When enabled, a user-settable ILuceneModelIndexer 
  interface class, default provided, is used to provide indexing of the model.</li>
  <li>Variable assignment now supported in rule premises, e.g., &quot;x is 3.19&quot;, via 
  assign built-in</li>
  <li>Bug-fix: checking to see if an instance specified as subject or object value is in 
  the domain or range was failing to properly 
  consider the super-class tree.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beta 20 release (2.1.8, 7/26/2012), for Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)<ul>
  <li>Fixed errors in translating property ranges to OWL</li>
  <li>Added warning for multiple single-valued &quot;described by&quot; lines for a given 
  class and property (such does NOT create a qualified cardinality restriction, 
  which is only supported in OWL 2)</li>
  <li>Minor bug fixes to rule/query/test translation of junctions</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beta 19 release (2.1.7, 7/11/2012), for Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)<ul>
  <li>Fixed bug in some values from restrictions that caused restrictions in one 
  model on a class in an imported model to generate improper OWL files.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Beta 18 release (2.1.6, 6/27/2012), for Eclipse 3.7 (Indigo)<ul>
  <li>Fixed egregious error that caused edited model to not be updated</li>
  <li>Improved cleanup of closed resources, both models and projects</li>

  formed. Also default configuration file placed in existing project when 
  missing wasn't being read</li>
  <li>Sometimes discovered built-ins added to the configuration.rdf file were 
  not saved</li>
  <li>Rule file reading modified to not give erroneous error if a non-UTF8 
  character exists in the rule file</li>

  <li>Fixed rule translation problems that resulted in truncated rule in Jena 
  when built-ins were nested inside of other built-ins.</li>
  <li>Import URI of the form &quot;<a href="file://somefile.sadl">file://somefile.sadl</a>&quot; 
  is deprecated; use SADL file name without prefix or else use model URI (there 
  is a quick fix for this; search for &quot;file://&quot; and use quick fix to update 
  import statement)</li>

<ul>
  <li>Grammar and code improvements to support more complete testing (see TestSadlIde project 
  for lots of new test cases)<ul>
  <li>Consistency of triple syntax improved: there are three possible syntaxes 
  for a triple pattern in a test, rule, or query<ol>
    <li>subject [has|with] predicate object</li>
    <li>predicate of subject is object</li>
    <li>object is predicate of subject</li>
  </ol>
  Note that only the &quot;has&quot; or &quot;with&quot; in the first (SPV) syntax is optional. Note 
  also that &quot;is&quot; between the predicate and object of the first syntax is not 
  admitted.</li>
  <li>There are four kinds of tests:<ol>
    <li>Equality: a triple to be matched or a left-hand side, right-hand side, 
    e.g., &quot;a friend of Jimmy = a friend of Johnny&quot; (&quot;is&quot;, &quot;=&quot;, or &quot;= =&quot; can be 
    used between the parts; this test will pass if there is a match, even if one 
    or the other has other friends)</li>
    <li>Negation: &quot;not&quot; is added to the syntax, e.g., &quot;the spouse of George is 
    not Maggie&quot;, &quot;a friend of Jimmy is not a friend of Johnny&quot; (to pass there 
    must not be any friends in common)</li>
    <li>Strict Equality: &quot;only&quot; is added to the syntax, e.g., &quot;the spouse of 
    George is only Martha&quot;, &quot;a friend of Ruby is only {[Ruth], [Fanny], 
    [Margarita]}&quot; (to pass Ruby must have exactly these friends an no others)</li>
    <li>Negation of Strict Equality: &quot;not only&quot; is added to the syntax, e.g., &quot;a 
    friend of Ruby is not only Fanny&quot; (to pass Ruby must have more values of 
    &quot;friend&quot; than just Fanny)</li>
  </ol>
  Note that &quot;known&quot; is a valid object value for testing and rules. It may be 
  used for Equality and Negation, but not with &quot;only&quot;.
</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>Resolved more mapping issues</li>
  <li>Other bug fixes</li>
</ul>
  </li>

  installed they will be discovered and available. A list of available built-ins 
  can be obtained within the context of a rule element by selecting the 
  &quot;built-in function..&quot; template from content assist (control-space).</li>

<h2><a name="InstallationInstructions2.2.0">Installation Instructions for SADL-IDE, 
Version 2.2.0 and Later</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>If not already installed, install Java 1.7 from
  <a href="http://www.java.com">http://www.java.com</a>&nbsp; (Java 1.7 required!). 
  (See <a href="#CheckJavaVersion">How to check Java Version</a>.) </li>
  <li>Download and install Eclipse Kepler (Eclipse Standard 4.3.x) from
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a> 
  . (Note: if unable to install the SADL update in the next step due to missing 
  requirements, install &quot;Eclipse IDE for Java and DSL Developers&quot;, which will 
  include the Xtext dependencies which are most likely the problem.) </li>
  <li>Start Eclipse Kepler, go to Help -&gt; Install New Software. Click on Add... 
  to create the new update site with Location
  <a href="http://sadl.sourceforge.net/kepler/update/">
  http://sadl.sourceforge.net/kepler/update/</a> and whatever Name you wish. 
  Click OK to install SADL. Select all features, accept the license 
  agreement, confirm installation and restart. </li>
  <li><b><font color="#ff0000">Note that the Eclipse workspace path must NOT 
  have any spaces or other non-URL compatible characters.</font></b> If needed, 
  switch to a different workspace on a valid (Unix-compatible) path (File -&gt; 
  Switch Workspace). </li>
  <li>The performance of the SADL-IDE is highly dependent upon the amount of 
  memory available to the application. If running in a 32-bit environment, the 
  memory available to the Java Virtual Machine is inherently limited to not much 
  more than 1 GB and may be less. On 64-bit machines with lots of memory, the 
  allocation to the JVM for Eclipse can be made much larger. To change the 
  maximum memory available, edit the &quot;eclipse.ini&quot; file in the &quot;eclipse&quot; folder 
  where you installed Eclipse. Change the line &quot;-Xmx512m&quot; (normal default 
  setting) to something larger, e.g., &quot;-Xmx4096m&quot; (64-bit) or &quot;-Xmx1024m&quot; 
  (32-bit). </li>
  <li>Optional: download the <a href="#DemonstrationProjects">demonstration 
  project TestSadlIde</a> to test SADL and provide examples of many knowledge 
  constructs. </li>

file as desired or switch to a ConsoleAppender. Add lines such as the last one 
in this file (without leading &quot;#&quot; comment indication) to control specific debug 
output. Place the properties file at some location, e.g., 
C:/java/workspace/logs. Create a shortcut to start Eclipse and add this to the 
commandline (with path adjusted to your file location):</p>

<p>After running the IDE, output from the specified packages will be in the log 
file and can be examined to gain additional insights into what is happening as 
the application runs. </p>
