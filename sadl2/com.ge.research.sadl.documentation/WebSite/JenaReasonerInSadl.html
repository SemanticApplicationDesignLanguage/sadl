<h1>Jena Reasoner in SADL</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>SADL uses a plug-in architecture allowing various reasoners, along with a 
corresponding translator, to be used with SADL. The first of these reasoners to 
be implemented, and the current default, is the Jena reasoner, wrapped in the 
class JenaReasonerPlugin.</p>
<h2>Jena Configuration</h2>
<p>The Jena reasoner is highly configurable, and the configuration can make a 
significant difference in inferencing results. For example, if an OWL 
equivalence class is created thought the use of the SADL construct &quot;only if&quot; in 
a class definition, a reasoner supporting OWL entailments may use this for 
classification. However, if the Jena reasoner configuration does not enable OWL 
entailments, no such results will occur. For details on Jena reasoner 
configurion, see <a href="JenaConfiguration.html">Jena Reasoner Configuration</a>.</p>
<h2>Jena Rule Built-ins Included in SADL</h2>
<p>Jena rules are very flexible in the way that they allow the inclusion of 
custom built-ins. Some built-ins are a part of the Jena distribution (see
<a href="http://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/#RULEbuiltins">
http://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/#RULEbuiltins</a>) while SADL 
supplies a variety of other built-ins found to be of practical value. For more 
information about Jena built-ins available in SADL see
<a href="BuiltinsProvided.html">Provided Jena Built-ins</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, Jena custom built-ins may be coded and deployed within SADL. For 
directions in doing so see <a href="CustomJenaBuiltins.html">Creating and Deploying Custom Jena Built-ins</a>.</p>
