<h2>What</h2>
<p>The Semantic Application Design Language (SADL) refers to two related things.</p>
<ol>
  <li>SADL is an <i><b>English-like language</b></i> for building formal models 
  composed of an OWL ontology, rules expressed in terms of the ontological 
  concepts, queries for retrieving information from the model, and tests to 
  validate and re-validate model content and entailments (implications);</li>
  <li>The SADL-IDE is an Eclilpse-based integrated development environment (IDE) 
  which&nbsp; <i><b>facilitate authoring and maintaining models</b></i> 
  expressed in the SADL language.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>The Semantic Technology (Web) stack offers significant potential for 
knowledge capture and usage in many domains of interest to GE. However, native 
representations (<a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/owl#w3c_all">OWL</a>,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/">SWRL</a>,
<a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/inference/index.html#rules">Jena Rules</a>,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/sparql#w3c_all">SPARQL</a>) are not 
very friendly to domain experts who are not computer scientists and 
knowledgeable in the intricacies of artificial intelligence and formal logic. 
Furthermore, the tools available to <i><b>build, test, maintain, and apply 
knowledge</b></i> bases (models) over their life cycle are inadequate. SADL 
attempts to bridge these gaps.</p>
<h2>How</h2>
<p>SADL attempt to meet the needs identified above in several ways.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The SADL grammar tries to use <i><b>common words</b></i> to express formal 
  model relationships. These key words and phrases are mapped unambiguously into 
  the formalisms of OWL, SWRL or Jena Rules, and SPARQL. </li>
  <li>SADL allows <i><b>combining of statements</b></i> so that the grouping is 
  much more concise and therefore understandable. Examples include listing the 
  properties that &quot;describe&quot; a class as part of the class definition, 
  identifying multiple subclasses in a single statement, the chaining together 
  of triple patterns in rules and queries to eliminate variables and make the 
  overall pattern more readable, listing the attributes and relationships of an 
  instance together with a single subject, and declaring instances with their 
  properties without necessarily requiring that they be given names.</li>
  <li>The SADL-IDE provides templates, content assistance, quick fixes, hyper 
  linking of concepts to their definitions, folding, and other <i><b>authoring 
  helps</b></i> to make it easier for domain experts to view and understand, 
  create, and maintain models expressed in the SADL language.</li>
  <li>The close integration of Eclipse with <b><i>source code control </i></b>
  tools such as CVS allow SADL models to be versioned and more easily managed 
  over their life cycle. The sequential nature of the language makes the viewing 
  of differences between versions of a model easy to compute and view. A set of 
  models may be easily tagged as a particular release and thereafter be 
  retrieved as a compete set at any time.</li>
  <li><i><b>Integration of reasoners/rules engines</b></i> with the SADL-IDE 
  allows the model developer to exercise the model, query inferred results, and 
  create test cases for validation and regression testing of the model.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many opportunities for additional aids for model authoring and 
lifecycle maintenance: graphical model visualization, model validation and gap 
analysis, etc.</p>
