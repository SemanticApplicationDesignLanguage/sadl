<h2>Some Definitions</h2>
<p><b>Semantic Technology</b> -- a way of encoding meaning in formal, logical models 
(called ontologies). The formal semantics allow inferences to be drawn. Rules 
may also be expressed in terms of the model concepts.</p>
<p><b>Ontology</b> -- a formal model that defines what does or can exist in a 
domain, including</p>
<ol>
  <li>Classes (concepts) -- abstract groups or sets<ol type="a">
    <li>defined intensionally by specifying the conditions of set membership, 
    e.g., Woman <font face="Times New Roman">&#8801; a Person whose age &gt;= 18 and 
    whose gender is Female</font></li>
    <li>defined extensionally by specifying the members of the set, e.g., 
    Season <font face="Times New Roman">&#8801; </font>{Spring, Summer, Fall, 
    Winter}</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Individuals (instances) -- proxies for &quot;real things&quot; in the modeled 
  domain, e.g., a Dog &quot;Lassie&quot;</li>
  <li>Properties -- [generalization of] characteristics or relationships of 
  individuals<ol type="a">
    <li>[simple] attributes (data type properties) have values that do not have 
    individual identity apart from the individual they describe: &quot;Lassie age 5&quot; 
    (&quot;5&quot; does not identify an instance in the domain)</li>
    <li>relationships associate an individual with another individual that has 
    separate identity: &quot;Lassie friend Spot&quot;</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><b>OWL (Web Ontology Language)</b> -- a formal (unambiguous) language that 
builds on RDF and RDFS and is informed by prior work including Description 
Logics (DL), OIL, DAML, and DAML+OIL</p>
<ol>
  <li>Classes, individuals, and properties are RDF resources and are identified 
  by URIs</li>
  <li>A model is built using statements (RDF triples) of the form &lt;subject&gt; 
  &lt;predicate&gt; &lt;object&gt;</li>
  <li>A model is a [mathematical] graph</li>
  <li>Different flavors of OWL have different expressiveness and different 
  decidability: OWL-Lite, OWL-DL, OWL-Full</li>
  <li>Models may be distributed, modular, extensible by language design</li>
</ol>
<p><b>SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language)</b> -- A W3C proposal that combines OWL 
(DL and Lite) with a subset of the Rule Markup Language (RuleML) </p>
<ol>
  <li>Provides a rule language that allows Horn-like rules to be combined with 
  an OWL knowledge base</li>
  <li>An extension of the OWL model-theoretic semantics to include rules</li>
  <li>May be part of a given model or an extension of it</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Jena Rules are similar to SWRL.</p>
<p><b>SPARQL (RDF query language)</b> -- A W3C proposed recommendation query 
language for RDF (and therefore OWL) models</p>
<ol>
  <li>Defined semantics as well as syntax</li>
  <li>A language for specifying graph patterns to be matched from a model</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Reasoner</b> -- a piece of software able to infer logical consequences 
from a model (set of assertions)</p>
<ol>
  <li>Given definition of Woman above and assertion &quot;Jane is a Woman&quot;, reasoner 
  infers 1) Jane age &gt;= 18 and 2) Jane gender Female</li>
  <li>Some reasoners can also process SWRL rules</li>
  <li>Reasoners may also be integrated with SPARQL query support</li>
  <li>Interesting reasoners:<ol type="a">
    <li>Pellet -- open source Java OWL-DL reasoner with explanation (version 
    supporting uncertainty nearing release)</li>
    <li>Jena -- open source Java framework supporting model&nbsp; creation, 
    persistence, and inference</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
