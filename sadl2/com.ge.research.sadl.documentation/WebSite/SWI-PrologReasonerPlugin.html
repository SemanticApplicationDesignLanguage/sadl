<h1>SWI-Prolog Reasoner/Translator Plug-in Pair for SADL</h1>
<h5>Last revised
<!--webbot bot="Timestamp" S-Type="EDITED" S-Format="%m/%d/%Y" startspan -->02/19/2016<!--webbot bot="Timestamp" endspan i-checksum="12645" -->.</h5>
<p>Note: This plug-in currently runs on Windows. Some additional work is 
required for launching the service on other operating systems.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI-Prolog</a> is a popular flavor of 
Prolog and one which is particularly well-suited for use with OWL due to its 
ability to load RDF Data. </p>
<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>Both the SWI-Prolog reasoner plug-in and the associated translator plug-in 
require that SWI-Prolog be available as a service. The translator uses the 
service to verify that built-in predicates used in rules are actually defined 
and the reasoner uses the service to do inference and to respond to queries.</p>
<h3>Install SWI-Prolog </h3>
<p>Assuming that an SWI-Prolog service is not already available and running, 
please follow these instructions to set up a local service.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download SWI-Prolog from <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html">
  http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html</a>. If you are running 64-bit 
  Eclipse, download the 64-bit version of SWI-Prolog. If you are running 32-bit 
  Eclipse, download the 32-bit version of SWI-Prolog. Version 6.2.5 of SWI-Prolog 
  is recommended. Later 6.x.x versions have been found to work in most respects 
  but may not properly handle exceptions. For a complete list of versions, 
  including 6.2.5, see
  <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable?show=all">
  http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable?show=all</a>. </li>
  <li>Install per instructions from download site.</li>
  <li>Add the Prolog bin folder to the environment path. Restart Eclipse if it 
  is already running. It may be necessary to reboot in order for SWI-Prolog to 
  work correctly from the Eclipse IDE.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Install SWI-Prolog for SADL</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Install the SADL-IDE and SWI-Prolog for SADL by following<a href="http://sadl.sourceforge.net/sadlv2release.html"> 
these instructions</a> but use the update site
<a href="http://sadl.sourceforge.net/kepler/swiprolog/update/">
http://sadl.sourceforge.net/kepler/swiprolog/update/</a>. </p>
<h2>User Guidance</h2>
<p>When the SWI-Prolog reasoner for SADL is requested, SADL will start the 
service provided that the executable (swipl-win.exe) is on the path.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the SWI-Prolog plug-ins for SADL, custom built-in functions 
(predicates) can be defined in Prolog and used in SADL rules. A template file is 
generated in which predicates can be defined or which can &quot;consult&quot; other .pl 
files containing the predicates. The following files are created in the 
OwlModels folder when the SWI-Prolog translator plug-in is run for a project.</p>
<ol>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">swi-run-prolog-service.pl -- this file is passed to the SWI-Prolog 
  executable and starts the service</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">swi-prolog-service.pl -- this file is loaded by the previous and 
  sets up the HTTP service used by the reasoner</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">swi-standard-declarations.pl -- contains standard declarations 
  and loads standard libraries for semantic web; loaded by first file in this 
  list</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
  <p dir="ltr">swi-custom-predicates.pl -- this is mean for the user to edit to 
  define custom predicates and/or to load other files; it is loaded by the first 
  file in this list</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
