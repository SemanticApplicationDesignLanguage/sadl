  <li><b>How do I cancel a build operation? </b><br>
  An Eclipse build is cancelled in the Progress view. This can be made visible 
  either by going to Window -&gt; Show View -&gt; Other and finding and clicking on 
  Progress or by clicking on the small icon in the very lower right corner of 
  the Eclipse window. When there is a build in progress, the Progress view will 
  display red buttons to cancel the operations that are in-progress.</li>
