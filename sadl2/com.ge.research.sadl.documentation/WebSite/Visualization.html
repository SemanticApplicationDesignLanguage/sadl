<p>The SADL-IDE Version 2.2.0.201411111033 and later includes the ability to 
visualize &quot;neighborhoods&quot; of a concept (class, property, or individual) as a 
graph. For classes, two graphs are generated: a class hierarchy graph and a 
property domains and ranges graph. This visualization capability uses GraphViz 
and must be configured as described below. When properly configured, the graphs 
are displayed in a separate &quot;dot&quot; window. A corresponding PNG image file is also 
created in the project's Temp folder.</p>
<p>SADL-IDE versions after April, 2015 include the ability to see the import 
tree of any file. Right-click on the target SADL file in the Project Explorer 
and select &quot;Sadl Actions&quot; -&gt; &quot;Graph Imports&quot;. The result will be a graph of 
imports with the selected model as the highlighted node.</p>
<p>GraphViz can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">
http://www.graphviz.org/</a> and should be placed on a path without spaces or 
other &quot;difficult&quot; path characters. Once installed, there should be a &quot;bin&quot; 
folder under the installation directory with &quot;dot&quot; and &quot;dotty&quot; executables.</p>
<p>The SADL-IDE is configured to use GraphViz by opening global preferences 
(Window -&gt; Preferences) . Click on &quot;Sadl&quot; in the left-side menu. The global 
preferences will include, at the bottom, &quot;GraphViz bin folder&quot;. Fill in the path 
to the bin folder of your installation, e.g., &quot;<a href="file:///C:/win32app/graphviz/release/bin">C:\win32app\graphviz\release\bin</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>A neighborhood can now be graphed by opening a model in the SADL editor and 
selecting the entire text of a concept name, then right-clicking for a context 
menu and selecting &quot;Graph Neighborhood&quot;. </p>
<p>Note that arbitrary graphs can also be created with the &quot;Ask: construct...&quot; 
directive in a SADL model. (See
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct">
http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#construct</a>.) The result of the SPARQL 
construct will be displayed as graph using GraphViz as described above.</p>
