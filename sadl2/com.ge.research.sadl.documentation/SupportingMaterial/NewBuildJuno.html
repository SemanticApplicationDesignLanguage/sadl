<h1>Instructions for Creating SADL Development Environment for Eclipse Juno, 
Xtext 2.3.1, SADL 2.2</h1>
<p>Starting with SADL 2.2.0 for Eclipse Juno (with Xtext 2.3), the entire build 
process has been Mavenized so that Eclipse update sites can be built using 
Maven. This will greatly decrease the amount of time required to build an 
update.</p>
<h2>Downloads and Installs</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download the complete Eclipse Juno with Xtext from
  <a href="http://eclipse.org/Xtext">http://eclipse.org/Xtext</a>.</li>
  <li>Make sure that Apache Maven 3.0 is installed on your machine, available 
  from <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">http://maven.apache.org/</a>, then 
  follow the installation instructions at the bottom of the download page.</li>
  <li>Configure Maven to use the desired repositories with modifications to the 
  .../.m2/settings.xml file</li>
  <li>In the Eclipse environment, check out projects from SourceForge, other 
  repositories as needed.(Or do directly with other source code control client.)</li>
  <li>Open command-line window and change directory to the 
  com.ge.research.sadl.build folder.</li>
  <li>Run mvn clean install (Options include &quot;-U&quot; to force refresh from Nexus 
  server, -X for complete debug output). </li>
  <li>Result should be a complete build of the update site. Install in fresh 
  Eclipse Juno and test.</li>
  <li>Note: refreshing the projects in Eclipse should also create a valid 
  development environment. Run the com.ge.research.sadl.ui project as an Eclipse 
  Application. Note that the workspace must be set to one without spaces in the 
  path, e.g., &quot;${workspace_loc}/../runtime-EclipseApplication&quot; and the JVM args 
  may need setting to provide more memory, e.g., &quot;-Xms120m -Xmx1024m&quot;.</li>
