<h1>Distribution of SADL on SourceForge</h1>
<h2>Building the Release</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Update the version number in the Overview tab of the plugin.xml file of 
  the com.ge.research.sadl and com.ge.research.sadl.ui projects. Save changes.</li>
  <li>Update the version number in the Overview tab of the feature.xml file of 
  the com.ge.research.sadl.feature project. (&quot;qualifier&quot; will be after the 
  version number). Save.</li>
  <li>On the same tab as #2, click on &quot;Synchronize&quot; and select the 
  first 
  option, &quot;Synchronize versions on build...&quot;, then click on Finish. Save 
  changes to feature.xml.</li>
  <li>Open &quot;site.xml&quot; in the com.ge.reaserch.sadl.update project. Update to the 
  latest in head from CVS to restore &quot;quantifier&quot; as the end of the version.</li>
  <li>If a new release, use &quot;Add Feature...&quot; to add the new feature. (Remove the 
  old feature?). Click on &quot;Build All&quot;. (Note: check changes to site.xml into CVS 
  BEFORE doing Build All as that replaces &quot;quantifier&quot; with the actual build.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The &quot;bin&quot; folders must be checked in the build.properties files to 
  generate the content in the distribution jars. Likewise for &quot;lib&quot; if jars are 
  to be included.</li>
  <li>It may be necessary to delete the content of the update project, including 
  the features and plugins folders, to get a complete &quot;Build All&quot; result.</li>
</ol>
<h2>SADL Update Site</h2>
<h3>Using Putty PSFTP</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Using an appropriate FTP client such as Putty PSFTP, change your local 
  directory to the local update project folder. (You can right-click on the 
  Eclipse project and select properties to see the actual disk location of the 
  Eclipse project.)</li>
  <li>Open a connection to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &lt;username&gt;,sadl@web.sourceforge.net<br>
  where &lt;username&gt; is your SourceForge userid.</li>
  <li>Change the SourceForge directory to the update foler: cd htdocs/update
  </li>
  <li>Transfer each file in the update folder (site.xml, content.jar, 
  atrifacts.jar) to the server. (This must be the site.xml file as modified by 
  the Build All.)</li>
  <li>Change both the local and remote current folder to the features folder:
  <br>
  lcd features<br>
  cd features</li>
  <li>Transfer the com.ge.research.sadl.feature_xxxxxxxx.jar file to the server 
  (xxxxx will change for each build of the update site)</li>
  <li>Change both the local and remote current folder to the plugins folder</li>
  <li>Transfer the two jar files in the plugins folder to the server</li>
</ol>
<h3>Using WinSCP</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Start WinSCP and enter
  <a href="mailto:%3Csf_username%3E,sadl@web.sourceforge.net">
  &lt;sf_username&gt;,sadl@web.sourceforge.net</a> as the host, enter username and 
  password, and click on Login.</li>
  <li>Navigate local file system on the left, SourceForge Web on the right, 
  copying files as desired. (Copy same files as in #3-8 above.)</li>
</ol>
<h2>SADL Web Site</h2>
<p>To transfer new content to the SourceForge Web site for SADL do the 
following.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Similar to the first two steps in the section above, use an appropriate 
  FTP client and connect with the local directory the WebSite folder containing 
  the Web content--the folder containing &quot;index.html&quot;.</li>
  <li>The remote folder should be the default, &quot;htdocs&quot;.</li>
  <li>Transfer all files in the WebSite folder to SourceForge. For example, with 
  PSFTP, use the &quot;mput *.*&quot; command.</li>
  <li>Change to each local folder and to the corresponding remote folder one by 
  one, recursively (walking down to the leaf folders) and repeat until all 
  content has been uploaded.</li>
  <li>Note: only changed files need to be uploaded.</li>
</ol>
